Chapter One: This is the secret to how I survived work this weekâ€”lots and lots of coffee. And creamer.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-taAMMhbuPAk/UMrBNAO6bZI/AAAAAAAARgU/yWLBvh12J70/s1600/petrie.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"upward facing dog\" border=\"0\" height=\"600\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-taAMMhbuPAk/UMrBNAO6bZI/AAAAAAAARgU/yWLBvh12J70/s640/petrie.JPG\" title=\"upward facing dog\" width=\"600\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\nChapter Two: My sister's pup Petrie came over one night for a sleepover. As a non-dog owner, I kept calling to ask her what his non-verbal communication meant. She insisted it didn't mean anything that he would just sit longingly by the front door with his back turned to me. I worried he wasn't having a good time, but Sophie said I was reading into it.&nbsp;</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h8533OzQmfU/UMrBOvZvbRI/AAAAAAAARgc/5HrCMcUt2k0/s1600/holiday+window.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"la pastaia san jose\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-h8533OzQmfU/UMrBOvZvbRI/AAAAAAAARgc/5HrCMcUt2k0/s1600/holiday+window.jpg\" title=\"la pastaia san jose\" /></a></div>\nChapter Three: Alan and I went to his company's holiday party last Friday. It was in a cute restaurant downtown, and the invitation billed it as an appetizers-only event. So we were super confused after eating our seventh round of shrimp cocktail and crostini when everyone took their seats to eat plates of pasta, tri-tip, chicken, and mashed potatoes. We were <i>really</i> full that night.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PbRTAeF4iFw/UMrBPzN7HGI/AAAAAAAARgk/hcyCAXzzMyg/s1600/bread+pudding.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"nordstrom cafe raspberry white chocolate bread pudding\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PbRTAeF4iFw/UMrBPzN7HGI/AAAAAAAARgk/hcyCAXzzMyg/s1600/bread+pudding.jpg\" title=\"nordstrom cafe raspberry white chocolate bread pudding\" /></a></div>\nChapter Four: Roy and I made a friend at Williams Sonoma. Here are a few fun facts about her:<br />\n<br />\n*She has a mini dachshund.<br />\n*Her brother got a mini dachshund to copy her.<br />\n*She hates washing dishes and will make any excuse to avoid doing them.<br />\n<br />\nI think we might spend too much time there, haha. On one of these shopping trips, we had dinner at the Nordstrom Cafe, and I finally tried their raspberry white chocolate bread pudding. (So good!)<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, I'm so happy it's Friday and can't wait to relax. I hope you have a good one!","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2143061457044672042/comments"},"labels":["To See","Weeklies"]}
