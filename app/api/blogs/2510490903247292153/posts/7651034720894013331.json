It used to be a U.S. army post, and the officers' residences have since been converted into guestrooms. I was excited to get to stay in one of the historic suites (vs. their contemporary lodging); they were so charming! It was crazy waking up and seeing the Golden Gate Bridge right in front of us every day, and the way everyone's buildings were spread out made it feel like we were at camp for grown ups.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7F-3vCHPZO4/TyXNaKUf8sI/AAAAAAAAMrM/R8e7VSn1fDo/s1600/what+i+ate.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7F-3vCHPZO4/TyXNaKUf8sI/AAAAAAAAMrM/R8e7VSn1fDo/s1600/what+i+ate.jpg\" /></a></div>What I'll miss the most, though, is the food! My favorite snacks to munch on were the truffle popcorn and truffle fries. For dinner one night, my team took a limo<span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">*</span> across the Golden Gate Bridge to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wu336U\" target=\"_blank\">Kokkari</a> where I had the best fish of my entire life! (Highly, highly recommend it!) Then, on the last day of the trip, a group of us ordered room service for breakfast and ate it in a sunroom. I've never dined in a sunroom before but it was something I could definitely get used to.<br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br />\n</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: x-small;\">*It was my first time ever riding in a limo and I was stoked! Then I quickly found out riding in limos makes me car sick â€” how do those celebrities do it?!&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: xx-small;\"><br />\n</span><br />\n(Kokkari fish image <a href=\"http://bit.ly/zpsQGT\" target=\"_blank\">via</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7651034720894013331/comments"},"labels":["To Eat","To See"]}
