When it's cold out, they're all some people will see of your outfit and can be staples in your closet for years. I've been searching for a classic camel-colored wool coat for such a long time, I was starting to think I'd never find one. But then, on a random shopping trip with my friend Roy, we strolled past this coat hanging out in the Aritzia store window. It's made of a crazy thick wool/cashmere blend which makes me feel like I'm under one seriously toasty blanket when I wear it. (Cozy central). I also love the slightly masculine cut balanced by a tailored fit and stand-up cocoon collar.<br />\n<br />\nWhich fall coats do you have your eye on this season?<br />\n<br />\n(<a href=\"http://bit.ly/TcRgoa\" target=\"_blank\">Cocoon Coat by Wilfred</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5224186049877513733/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
