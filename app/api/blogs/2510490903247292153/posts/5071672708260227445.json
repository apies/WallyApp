Instead, I made spicy tuna rice bowls which needed minimal cooking (just the rice) but tasted delicious and fresh. Rice bowls are so easy to make that I can already tell they're going to be a summer staple when I want to stay in for dinner but don't feel like cooking. (My other favorite rice bowl combination is fried eggs sunny-side up or over-medium with soy sauce--yum!)  <div><br /></div><div>Spicy tuna:</div><div>half pound sushi-grade tuna (I get mine <a href=\"http://bit.ly/jAGLpj\">here</a>) </div><div>4-5 teaspoons soy sauce</div><div>2-3 scallions, chopped (the white and green parts)</div><div>2 teaspoons kewpie mayo</div><div>2-3 teaspoons Sriracha</div><div><br /></div><div>Rice:</div><div>1 cup sushi rice</div><div>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</div><div><br /></div><div>Toppings: </div><div>roasted seaweed</div><div>avocado</div><div>cucumber</div><div>sesame seeds</div><div><br /></div><div>Cook rice per package instructions. Transfer to a bowl and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside. Chop tuna and place in a small bowl. Add scallions, soy sauce, mayo, and sriracha to tuna and mix together. Place rice in serving bowls and add spicy tuna. Garnish with desired toppings. (Note: adjust spicy tuna seasonings and rice vinegar to taste -- I like my spicy tuna a bit spicier than most and a little less mayo-y).<br /><div><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xf4tIT49WbM/Tf7MJ8xUvAI/AAAAAAAAI5Y/KEBhy7htXLg/s1600/veggies.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xf4tIT49WbM/Tf7MJ8xUvAI/AAAAAAAAI5Y/KEBhy7htXLg/s1600/veggies.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5620153856308853762\" /></a><br /></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5071672708260227445/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
