I've lived in the Bay Area almost my entire life, but I've never been to Napa. Maybe it's because I'm not a big wine drinker, but for whatever reason, I never made it a point to visit. That all changed yesterday, though, when I drove up and spent the day there with friends. The wineries we visited were just as pretty as I expected, but the real highlights were the perfect weather and the rolling hills everywhere that looked like a scene straight from a postcard. And the food! <i>The food</i>. We started off at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ggh7n6\">Bouchon Bakery</a> where I tried their legendary macarons (yum) and ended at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/e7yxMF\">Dean &amp; Deluca</a>, the mecca of gourmet goodness. Everything in the store was exquisitely arranged, and we found all the perfect items for our picnic lunch. <div><br /><div><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jER9H510jGU/TZlTqddyLuI/AAAAAAAAGfM/SOBPscWSMb4/s1600/picnic.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jER9H510jGU/TZlTqddyLuI/AAAAAAAAGfM/SOBPscWSMb4/s1600/picnic.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5591592401286344418\" /></a>We spread out towels by the creek at Bale Grist Mill Park and sat in the sun eating, chatting and dipping our toes in the water. </div><div><br /></div><div>Now that the weather's getting nice, I can't wait to have more picnics.
