We just got from our Maui adventure. Stepping off the plane into the cold grey morning was a little bit of a shock to our systems (I was wearing a sleeveless dress and Alan was wearing shorts, ha!), but I feel relaxed and rejuvenated. I have to go wash the ocean out of my hair now since we took a red-eye flight after swimming and beaching all day, but I'll be back with more pictures soon.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7408134644562918702/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
