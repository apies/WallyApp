Can you imagine how exciting it must be going to all those shows? I would absolutely love to get invited one day (note to self: add that to list of things to do), but I know I'd be <i>so </i>nervous. As much as I love fashion and style, I kinda put fashion editors and fashion-makers on the same level as celebrities, so being in a room full of them would be intimidating. But who knows? Maybe they are the most down-to-earth bunch who tell the best jokes. I'll be sure to let everyone know just as soon as I get that invite... Well, now that that's decided, what to wear? I love these crazy floppy hats that somehow end up looking super chic. (I'm not sure if I could pull one off, but hey! This is future me we're talking about--we'll let her worry about that!)  <a href=\"http://bit.ly/pXLtlc\">This one</a> looks pretty perfect for fall, sitting front row at fashion week or not.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kDTeWcpi0Fk/TmmqrwmGhuI/AAAAAAAAJWk/ESKkc8uX9us/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-09-08+at+10.32.56+PM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kDTeWcpi0Fk/TmmqrwmGhuI/AAAAAAAAJWk/ESKkc8uX9us/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-09-08+at+10.32.56+PM.png\" width=\"500\" /></a></div><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EvTnwsp3adA/TmmqtXGGg_I/AAAAAAAAJWo/lEHZjtQ3P9E/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-09-08+at+10.32.31+PM.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"450\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-EvTnwsp3adA/TmmqtXGGg_I/AAAAAAAAJWo/lEHZjtQ3P9E/s1600/Screen+shot+2011-09-08+at+10.32.31+PM.png\" width=\"300\" /></a></div><br />\n(From top to bottom, images via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/qX0nAn\">The Sartorialist</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/mT08sy\">The Glitter Guide</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/poZRpl\">The Glitter Guide</a> by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/oHil3L\">Kristy Ahumada</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4499241298441396799/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
