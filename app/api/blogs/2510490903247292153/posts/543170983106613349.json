At work, we're lucky to have this huge flower shipper right next door. On Fridays, they sell $5 bouquets and everyone walks over to see. If you don't like any of the pre-arranged bouquets, the people that run the place are incredibly sweet and will let you roam around in their back cooler where there are a gazillion different flowers to pick from. I've seen so many different kinds that I've never seen before, so it's kind of an exciting adventure every time I'm there.<br />\n<br />\nOne day, in a moment of overwhelming flower-picking indecision, I asked the owner what her favorite flower was. She had to think about it for a few minutes, but then decided if she could only pick one, it would definitely be peonies. I don't have a favorite, but I like the idea of having one. It would make it all the more special when people surprised you with them. My cousin Denise loves dahlias, my sister loves daffodils and&nbsp;lilies. Do you have a favorite?<br />\n<br />\n(Top photo by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/yTDjNE\" target=\"_blank\">Oh Happy Day</a>, bottom photo by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wZwboL\" target=\"_blank\">Amy Merrick</a>)<br />\n<br />\np.s. Isn't that bottom photo mysterious and magical? Like she is sneaking away to visit her groom for a quiet moment on their big day right before the sunrise.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"9","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/543170983106613349/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
