Lots and lots of layers. Then I think about J. Crew because if there's anyone who knows layers, it would be them. I never cease to be impressed at how their stylists have perfected the layered look and find myself constantly coveting their adorable outfits. So, last weekend, I styled my own J. Crew-inspired look with a few of my favorite pieces and a pair of DIY cut-off shorts.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqmSU04UI/AAAAAAAAEmM/A5f5D0Q9fSY/s1600/jcrew+layers.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px; height: 672px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqmSU04UI/AAAAAAAAEmM/A5f5D0Q9fSY/s1600/jcrew+layers.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530748654630265154\" border=\"0\" /></a>To make the shorts, I went into my closet and found a pair of jeans too flare-y for my current tastes. They were my very first pair of designer jeans ever (they're by 7 For All Mankind and I yearned for them most of my entire freshmen year of college until I finally gave in, saved all my milk money and bought a pair) so it was hard to think about altering them, but I never wear them anymore anyway, so they were the perfect candidate for cut-off shorts. I always seem to make things shorter than I intend them to be, so I added on a few extra inches when deciding on the length. I used a ruler to make sure both sides would be even and began snipping away.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEql8rqI7I/AAAAAAAAEmE/rmvVlTyroiU/s1600/roll+up+your+sleeves.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 450px; height: 672px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEql8rqI7I/AAAAAAAAEmE/rmvVlTyroiU/s1600/roll+up+your+sleeves.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530748648820450226\" border=\"0\" /></a>Peeling back the layers: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/autWHA\">Gibson blazer</a>, Kersh cardigan, Old Navy tie blouse<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqlv1doqI/AAAAAAAAEl8/0YWS3J4XNRU/s1600/shoes+and+socks.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 374px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqlv1doqI/AAAAAAAAEl8/0YWS3J4XNRU/s1600/shoes+and+socks.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530748645371912866\" border=\"0\" /></a>Say yes to socks and shorts!<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqlrBD1yI/AAAAAAAAEl0/a9iy1zeLU7A/s1600/warm+beverages.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TMEqlrBD1yI/AAAAAAAAEl0/a9iy1zeLU7A/s1600/warm+beverages.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5530748644078376738\" border=\"0\" /></a>And then have a warm cup of coffee and enjoy your weekend!","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"5","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5427087758345816009/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
