It's funny to think about keeping chickens when you don't live on a full-fledged farm, but it'd be so homey having them in your backyard and just imagine how amazing it would be to gather your own eggs for breakfast each day. It seems like keeping your own chickens is growing in popularity though (or maybe I just never paid as close attention before) because I know at least 3 people at work who have them! I was telling my friend Lauren last week about how I wanted some chickens one day, and yesterday, she surprised me with my own desktop chicken coop complete with little chicks. Isn't she the sweetest? The little sign has a tiny calendar on the flip side. I love it! It's from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/zRPw1N\" target=\"_blank\">Scout Creative's 3D Calendar of the Month Club</a> (that's free!). She found it via&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/xqvl2q\" target=\"_blank\">this crafty blog</a>.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3947858260452991643/comments"},"labels":["crafts","office talk","To See"]}
