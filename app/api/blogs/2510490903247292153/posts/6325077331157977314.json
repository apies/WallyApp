It's an excuse to wear a bold shade of lipstick and to take extra care in getting your hair just so. I love outfits that don't require too much fuss, so I took inspiration from a few great places and put together a simple 4-step holiday look. <br /><br />Step 1: Wear something with history. The holidays are steeped in traditions, and my string of pearls (given to my by my mom) reminds me of this. Sometimes I'll put them on and think about all the parties and special occasions she wore her pearls to before they became mine.<br /><br />Step 2: Curl your hair. I loved this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fwzaxN\">modern chignon</a> and followed these <a href=\"http://bit.ly/h1Vrs7\">directions</a>.  (Or for a really easy party 'do, check out <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gb5FK6\">this tutorial</a>).<br /><br />Step 3: Wear a red pout. I don't normally wear lipstick, but this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fFqerv\">rave review</a> for Maybelline's Color Sensational intrigued me. I picked Very Cherry which is bright red. (Fact: When I wore it to Thanksgiving everyone kept saying \"Your lips are so bright!\" I wasn't sure if that was supposed to be a compliment or not, but I loved how the color really brightened up my face and made me feel festive).<br /><br />Step 4: Pick a pretty blouse. The pintucking, beading, and arm details make this my go-to white blouse for dressier occasions.  <br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPdHsLqzWGI/AAAAAAAAEys/wCwRmWi--k0/s1600/4%2Bstep%2Bholiday%2Blook.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPdHsLqzWGI/AAAAAAAAEys/wCwRmWi--k0/s1600/4%2Bstep%2Bholiday%2Blook.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5545980290502187106\" border=\"0\" /></a><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPdHsCpTQZI/AAAAAAAAEyk/-YqW8zyYPEs/s1600/holiday%2Bchignon.jpg\"><br /></a><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPiUQxeReuI/AAAAAAAAEzE/N3QONkuEC64/s1600/holiday%2Bhair.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPiUQxeReuI/AAAAAAAAEzE/N3QONkuEC64/s400/holiday%2Bhair.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5546345956985895650\" border=\"0\" /></a>(A better view of the side chignon curls)<br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6325077331157977314/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
