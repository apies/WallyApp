Luckily Chipotle was also everywhere so I ordered&nbsp;the chicken salad&nbsp;with pinto beans, extra fajita veggies, tomato salsa, and a little bit of red tomatilla salsa. I know fast food is almost always a bad idea for beach babeliness,&nbsp;but wait! Hear me out for a second. It's basically grilled chicken, beans, and veggies which are good sources of lean protein, fiber, and micronutrients. It's become my fast food dinner of choice whenever we're too tired or lazy to cook after work.<br />\n<br />\n<b>What do you think? Is fast food all the same? What do you eat when your kitchen's not nearby?&nbsp;</b><br />\n<b><br /></b><br />\n(image by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/JdG1VY\" target=\"_blank\">Trevor Pearson</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3967612925676274323/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
