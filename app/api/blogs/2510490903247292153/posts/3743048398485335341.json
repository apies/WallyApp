I made it this weekend for dinner at a friend's house, and the whole thing was gone in a matter of minutes. As an afterthought, I found some heavy whipping cream in the fridge so I made some whipped cream to go along with it, but in the future (and if you are going to make this) I would strongly advise not skipping this step--the combination together is all kinds of good. This cake's recipe reminds me of the batter used in this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/l0tOr7\">blueberry cobbler</a>, which I loved, so I had high hopes. It turned out to be so easy to make and is now one of my favorite cake recipes ever. It's light, buttery, strawberry-y and has such a fabulous name.<div> <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; \"><br /><img src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-75l_lBU0tG8/TeM33RdUpkI/AAAAAAAAGt0/y26SDqsnBUI/s1600/cake.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612390983352493634\" style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px; \" /></span></div><div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Originally, I was thinking I'd make something with blueberries or peaches, but after a trip to the farmer's market, I knew it had to involve strawberries. After weeks of buying strawberries at Safeway that <i>looked</i> delicious but tasted sour, the ones I found this weekend looked good and, most importantly, <i>smelled and tasted amazing</i>.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"-webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; \"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" ><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7B-k0vPKx9c/TeM33hzBSWI/AAAAAAAAGt8/VOsChkN-XuY/s1600/strawberries.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612390987738466658\" style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px; \" /></span></span></span></div><div>This cake is so good that after getting home from dinner near midnight, what did I do? I went straight to the kitchen and made another one (although to my credit I did half the recipe to limit my gluttony) so we could have some with coffee the next morning. Midnight baking is admittedly a bit torturous since you're just going to sleep after pulling the most glorious smelling cake out of the oven, but seeing it on the counter all ready to go first thing in the morning makes it totally worth it.</div><div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ZVpAncGOAQ/TeM33LuEyUI/AAAAAAAAGts/fbxxtHP6VCQ/s1600/breakfast.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-7ZVpAncGOAQ/TeM33LuEyUI/AAAAAAAAGts/fbxxtHP6VCQ/s1600/breakfast.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5612390981812144450\" style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px; \" /></a><div style=\"text-align: left;\">The second time I made it, I sprinkled a full tablespoon of sugar over the top (instead of the teensy sprinkle I did the first time), and I was much more pleased with the results.
