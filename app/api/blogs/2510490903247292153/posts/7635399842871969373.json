Alan and I ordered in pizza and had a Battlestar Galactica marathon. Since we didn't get dressed up, I thought it'd be fun to dress up the next day and take some pictures. I've also been thinking about my new year's resolutions, and since I don't believe in making a ton of lofty ones I'll be bound to break, I've narrowed it down to just two:<br />\n<br />\n1) Do a pull up. Just because I've never been able to! We just got a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/s9RQ28\" target=\"_blank\">special bar</a> that fits in our charmingly vintage (but absurdly difficult to find a pull up bar for) doorways, so now I have no excuses.<br />\n<br />\n2) End each day with a clean coffee table. This one is in line with my deep desire to live a more simple, less-cluttered life, and is one concrete thing I can do to help get me there. It's kind of like the power making the bed has in turning a messy room into a tidier one.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that's it! Did you make any resolutions? Maybe we can help hold each other accountable. ;)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7635399842871969373/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
