It’s kinda like how everyone who visits the Leaning Tower of Pisa has to get a picture of them pushing it back into place. When Alan went bouldering a few weeks ago, he sent me this one and I nearly died.&nbsp;But after I realized it was fake, my worry turned into being really impressed—it looks so real!&nbsp;What are your favorite funny poses?</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\">\n<br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6922695795443987037/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
