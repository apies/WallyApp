Did you dress up today? My team at work is dressing up as the Addams Family, and I'll be Morticia. It's probably the least nerdy costume I've had in years which makes me a little sad, but I wanted to share in the team spirit. I hope we win the group costume contest! (We're even singing and dancing, haha). After Halloween, it always feels like a mad dash to the end of the year, doesn't it? It would be lovely to squeeze in more brisk, rosy-cheeked adventures this fallâ€”even if it's doing something simple, like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/TtyvfB\" target=\"_blank\">visiting a working farm</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Ug5hgT\" target=\"_blank\">finding the best cup of apple cider</a>. Just make sure to wear something warm and cozy. I like to wear a big grandpa sweater, my oldest jeans, simple jewelry, and tall boots. :)<br />\n<br />\n{I'm wearing an <a href=\"http://bit.ly/TtzU5I\" target=\"_blank\">Abacus Row necklace</a>, a cardigan from H&amp;M, Seven jeans, and Hunter wellies.}","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1810119150390458315/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
