(But rest assured we had tons of other dinner items I probably found as equally horrifying â€” stingray, anyone?) When I'd see them at the grocery store, I'd ask my mom about them because I loved their miniature cabbage shape, but she'd always push the cart right past them. After a life devoid of these veggies for the past few decades, they didn't make their way back onto my radar until just this year. In January I had the best brussels sprouts I've ever tasted at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/wQxwLv\" target=\"_blank\">Murray Circle</a>&nbsp;and then had wonderfully crispy brussels sprouts at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/wpr9Zj\" target=\"_blank\">Nick's</a>&nbsp;earlier this month. How could I be such a fan and not have known it all these years? I came across this <a href=\"http://bonapp.it/yLNWKq\" target=\"_blank\">brussels sprouts with bacon recipe</a> in Bon Appetit and knew I had to make it. They were easy to whip up, and the end result was a tasty gourmet vegetable that even Alan liked. These are my new favorite vegetable and side dish.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c8Ro1ZCiFDg/T2AgrBX5XBI/AAAAAAAANAI/4QWFSwwBoJw/s1600/sauteed+brussel+sprouts.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c8Ro1ZCiFDg/T2AgrBX5XBI/AAAAAAAANAI/4QWFSwwBoJw/s1600/sauteed+brussel+sprouts.jpg\" /></a></div><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><i>&nbsp;{photos by Quiet Like Horses}</i>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2381585516210103141/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
