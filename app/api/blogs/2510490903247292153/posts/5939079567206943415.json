On Saturday mornings it is one of my favorite rituals to think about what I really want to eat that morning (instead of the usual bowl of cereal I eat at work), and I've found that I often crave very simple foods for breakfast. When I want to feel like I've been whisked away to Paris, I'll fix myself some hearty toast using <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hNE38Z\">good bread</a> with a nice pat of salted butter and thick blueberry jam. I could probably eat this every morning.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSbXDaW5VcI/AAAAAAAAE-w/KwFu5QdpaHo/s1600/bacon%2Band%2Beggs.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSbXDaW5VcI/AAAAAAAAE-w/KwFu5QdpaHo/s1600/bacon%2Band%2Beggs.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5559367243650389442\" border=\"0\" /></a>On days when I need a savory start, I'll go the traditional bacon and eggs route. When I was very young, I almost exclusively ate my eggs scrambled. As I grew older, I liked my eggs sunny side up. In my teens, I preferred them over-medium, and now that I'm in my twenties, I like them medium-boiled.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSbXDNaKoaI/AAAAAAAAE-o/c63XS0s7uVw/s1600/yogurt%2Band%2Ba%2Bcookie.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSbXDNaKoaI/AAAAAAAAE-o/c63XS0s7uVw/s1600/yogurt%2Band%2Ba%2Bcookie.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5559367240174444962\" border=\"0\" /></a>Some days I will eat breakfast according to a \"dessert first\" philosophy. I try not to have too many of these days, but sometimes, starting the morning with a cookie and some Fage is just too good.<br /><br />And always, always, even if not pictured, coffee must be had with every breakfast. It is only right.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5939079567206943415/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
