We were all visiting a tailor anyway to have a few things made (work pants, blouses, things like that) and so I brought in a picture of this one dress I had had my eye on for forever. We went to the market to buy fabric and in the end the whole dress (fabric + the seamstress' time) ended up costing a total of $75! It was a crazy deal for a wedding dress, and she did an amazing job.<br />\n<br />\nI've talked about <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Js9esK\" target=\"_blank\">my feelings on getting married</a> before—specifically that Alan and I'd eventually get married when the time feels right—but it was only really recently that something clicked inside of me and all of a sudden I found myself feeling completely ready! It's odd to feel this way after feeling like I could care less for so long, but exciting at the same time. We still have quite a ways to go before we actually get married, but I just thought I'd share how I've been feeling :).There's a glimpse of the dress below, and—because I just couldn't help it—here's our reserved <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IFqW2B\" target=\"_blank\">wedding domain name</a>.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<br /></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hPzHefhvjL8/T6IgPAJ3jFI/AAAAAAAANco/BJrRGum53k4/s1600/wedding+dress.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"whimsical wedding dress\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hPzHefhvjL8/T6IgPAJ3jFI/AAAAAAAANco/BJrRGum53k4/s1600/wedding+dress.jpg\" title=\"whimsical wedding dress\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sbgf7wRZLWc/T6IgOebYsKI/AAAAAAAANcg/teLkqYztLxo/s1600/pies.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"mini apple pies\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Sbgf7wRZLWc/T6IgOebYsKI/AAAAAAAANcg/teLkqYztLxo/s1600/pies.jpg\" title=\"mini apple pies\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n<br />","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/744783066846139468/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
