Unfortunately (as it is with so many jobs), all the open positions I found were looking for people with a few years' experience. Without any copywriting experience on my resume, it seemed almost impossible to break into the profession, so I decided to heck with it, and wrote a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/eYTpvb\">non-conventional cover letter</a> in about 20 minutes. It was actually more of a story than an actual cover letter, and it felt electrifying to write it. I sent it off to a small company that sounded like a perfect fit and was thrilled when they responded! I ended up working there for a year and felt pretty happy with myself for my creativity. Now I feel silly once I see the things other people put together to land their dream jobs. My newest admiration: this webpage a creative gal named Netta put together called <a href=\"http://bit.ly/g75wCa\">www.IWannaWorkAtInstagram.com</a>. It's so simple yet so clever. I hope she gets the job!</div><div><br /></div><div>(p.s. a really <a href=\"http://bit.ly/furXqH\">cool CV</a>)</div><div><br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4309380286072934395/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
