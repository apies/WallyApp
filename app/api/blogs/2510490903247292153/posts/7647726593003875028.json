It was my first time, but with my love of a good loaf, my trusty Le Creuset (Alan calls it the iPot since it's so fancy shmancy, haha), and this <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/eJPWT7\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">awesome </span>recipe</a>, I baked two perfect loaves. The first was a test loaf because even though this recipe has gotten rave reviews, I was a bit wary that it might actually be trickier than it seemed. Aside from a bit of planning around the long rise (about 20 hours), it was so easy to make. And the taste... oh, the taste. It had a perfect crust-- crispy, slightly chewy, substantial, but definitely not too tough-- and a super moist interior with an open irregular crumb structure. (Note: crumb is a term that bakers use to define the inside/holey-ness of the bread. I learned this after this baking experience and am tucking this tidbit away for the next cocktail party I go to -- being the life of the party takes a lot of work! ;)<br /> <br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacX_rpiI/AAAAAAAAE8g/jGxb5g4k428/s1600/first%2Brise%2B.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacX_rpiI/AAAAAAAAE8g/jGxb5g4k428/s1600/first%2Brise%2B.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5555148846397105698\" border=\"0\" /></a>This bread starts out like the ugly duckling. When I first mixed the ingredients together, I looked in the bowl and was sure I did something wrong. It looked like a big mess, but sure enough, 20 hours later (I had aimed for just 18, but got carried away with holiday fun) it had turned into a nice dough.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacJAO2wI/AAAAAAAAE8Y/Ea_ly1I9NUA/s1600/dough.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacJAO2wI/AAAAAAAAE8Y/Ea_ly1I9NUA/s1600/dough.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5555148842372881154\" border=\"0\" /></a>I formed the dough into a ball and marveled at its swan-like beauty.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacC-6GHI/AAAAAAAAE8Q/8p5i-nVD6H8/s1600/beautiful%2Bfresh%2Bloaf.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfacC-6GHI/AAAAAAAAE8Q/8p5i-nVD6H8/s1600/beautiful%2Bfresh%2Bloaf.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5555148840756713586\" border=\"0\" /></a>We devoured the entire first loaf with just a bit of butter and some salami -- you know, just to make sure it was Christmas-dinner worthy :). I made the next loaf on Christmas morning, and after I pulled it out of the oven, I stuck my face in close and just inhaled. The smell of fresh baked bread is something else.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfab9ZBMmI/AAAAAAAAE8I/HWKlk6QPDXo/s1600/christmas%2Bdinner.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRfab9ZBMmI/AAAAAAAAE8I/HWKlk6QPDXo/s1600/christmas%2Bdinner.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5555148839255618146\" border=\"0\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">(Christmas dinner plate)<br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"11","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7647726593003875028/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
