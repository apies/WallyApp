Even though I'm not the biggest college sports fan, our schools' rivalry makes poking fun of each other a daily treat. One day I saw that he had put up a school pennant on his wall, so the next day, to show my own school spirit, I wore my favorite UCLA t-shirt. It made me feel smug, even if no one else noticed but me. I always think it's funny when people take their schools' rivalries ultra seriously.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Who's your school's biggest rival?
