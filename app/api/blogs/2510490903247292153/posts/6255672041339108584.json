This time, I tried buttercream frosting instead of the sumptuous cream cheese frosting I tried last time and found that buttercream is for sure much better at holding its stiffness. For a long time the roses I piped looked like blobby, mushy flowers which Alan assured me looked good, but I refused to stop. Finally, after a good few hours, they started to look better. I know they're nowhere near as good as some other buttercream roses out there, but I hope these will knock a sock or two off at the Thanksgiving table this year.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"10","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6255672041339108584/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
