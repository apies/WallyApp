(Cozy :) Having them here reminds me of the perks of living with fun roommates: we've cooked meals together and gone on after-dinner walks, and they give me rides home from work and don't talk through movies. This weekend, Sophie's going to demystify how to use a diffuser when blowdrying my hair to get curls like hers and giving me an eye makeup tutorial. I can't wait. Have a beautiful weekend! <br />\n<ul style=\"list-style: square;\"></ul>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/825674543908081698/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
