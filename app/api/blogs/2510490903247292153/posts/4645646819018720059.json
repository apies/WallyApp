My talented friend Phuong designed these for me -- aren't they adorable? My favorite part is how the leaf design is reversed out on the other side.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TLVGLW8W7TI/AAAAAAAAEiw/0G4XoHDenoY/s1600/reversed+out.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TLVGLW8W7TI/AAAAAAAAEiw/0G4XoHDenoY/s1600/reversed+out.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527401278618398002\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TLVGLFd-76I/AAAAAAAAEio/KyvJR-8HCdg/s1600/the+business+of+business+cards.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TLVGLFd-76I/AAAAAAAAEio/KyvJR-8HCdg/s1600/the+business+of+business+cards.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5527401273927593890\" border=\"0\" /></a>Maybe it's just me, but I think a pretty calling card can make quite an impact and help people remember you. Case in point: my friends Sue and Thai recently went on a trip to the East Coast (I was jealous) and brought me back a couple of unique cards from two Brooklyn businesses (I've never been, but Brooklyn seems <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">so </span>cool).  They're the top two -- the oversized one from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/9N3J31\">domestic construction </a>and the one that reminds me of a rucksack from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/bAbrII\">nydesignroom</a>. The bright red one is from a tiny bar my friends and I discovered on a fantastic, insane 3-day trip to London a few years ago. I keep it out on my dresser because it reminds me of all the craziness and fun of that trip which is a nice way to start the morning.<br /><br />p.s.
