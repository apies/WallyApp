Costco was selling them at some ridiculous price, and I just couldn't help myself. I wanted to start testing out recipes for the holidays with them. The idea was to make something beautiful, something a little bit fancier than your standard pumpkin pie, but also something simple that wouldn't make the holidays crazier than they already are. This brown butter raspberry tart nailed it. Aside from it being super pretty, it tastes amazing — the richness of the brown butter complements the tartness of the raspberries really well, and the shortbread crust gives every bite a nice cookie crunch ending. When I asked Alan if he wanted a piece, he said he wasn't a big fan of tarts, but politely said he'd try a little. He ended up eating half of it in one sitting. Needless to say, this is definitely a front-runner for the Thanksgiving dessert table. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-glzezXF_2JY/Tpu-Awcaw4I/AAAAAAAAJfA/IOQHdf4UIhQ/s1600/raspberry+tart.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-glzezXF_2JY/Tpu-Awcaw4I/AAAAAAAAJfA/IOQHdf4UIhQ/s1600/raspberry+tart.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PdXRtcLXFo4/Tpu-AWn0WuI/AAAAAAAAJew/NIgABzxJ6qQ/s1600/tart+3.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PdXRtcLXFo4/Tpu-AWn0WuI/AAAAAAAAJew/NIgABzxJ6qQ/s1600/tart+3.jpg\" /></a></div><br />\n<br />\nBrown Butter Raspberry Tart<br />\nAdapted from <a href=\"http://epi.us/rowt2G\">Bon Appetit</a><br />\n<br />\nCrust:<br />\n7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted<br />\n1/3 cup sugar<br />\n1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />\n1 cup plus 1 tablespoon all purpose flour<br />\nPinch of salt<br />\n<br />\nFilling:<br />\n1/2 cup sugar<br />\n2 large eggs<br />\nPinch of salt<br />\n1/4 cup all purpose flour<br />\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, diced<br />\n2 6-ounce containers fresh raspberries<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nFor crust: <br />\nPosition rack in center of oven and preheat to 375°F.

Cook butter in heavy small saucepan over medium heat until deep nutty brown (do not burn), stirring often, about 6 minutes.

Carefully pour browned butter mixture evenly over berries. Place tart on rimmed baking sheet.
