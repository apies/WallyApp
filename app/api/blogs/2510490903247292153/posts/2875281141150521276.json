Mine would definitely be Keri Russell. She&nbsp;has such a natural, friendly look. (Is it weird to describe someone's look as friendly?)&nbsp;I've loved her since <i>Felicity, </i>so it was a pleasant nostalgic surprise to find that&nbsp;Netflix is streaming all four seasons of the show. I'm re-watching from the very beginning, and at first I thought it might feel like a guilty pleasure, especially since I started watching the show when I was a freshmen in high school, but I can say for sure that it's still one of my favorite shows ever. I love the music, the quiet, moody way it's shot, and how exciting it makes NY look. Not to mention that looker Scott Speedman! (When my friend Jennifer used to live in L.A., she'd see Scott Speedman at the coffee shop down the block from her apartment, and I'd always feel giddy when she'd text me about her Scott sightings).<br />\n<br />\np.s. Alan has a devoted man crush on Matthew McConaughey ;)<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bWweEL-NXUM/ToQAWPK-n6I/AAAAAAAAJaU/utJeLzF8c10/s1600/matthew_mcconaughey1_300_40+%25281%2529.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"400\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bWweEL-NXUM/ToQAWPK-n6I/AAAAAAAAJaU/utJeLzF8c10/s400/matthew_mcconaughey1_300_40+%25281%2529.jpg\" style=\"cursor: move;\" width=\"300\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">(second image via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/nRWr8E\">Lily Lemontree</a>, bottom image via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/p7FYj3\">people.com</a>)</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2875281141150521276/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
