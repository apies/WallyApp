The first place we saw was the size of a shoebox. The girls that lived there were nice. Although I didn't end up living there, I will always remember them because they were the ones who first told me about Tartine. Ever since that day, I have been in love with this bakery. Everyone I've taken also falls in love. One other thing I love is this video about Tartine's bread. Chad Robertson, the owner, really digs bread which makes me feel more normal about my own bread and Tartine obsession.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2102225892590902612/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
