We moved into our new apartment, went to the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fmHvqI\">Content stinky cheese party</a>, and ran around trying to get odds and ends taken care of before I leave for Asia on Friday. There are so many things to think about before leaving, like the fact that the new place has windows--lots and lots of windows. Having all these windows everywhere suddenly makes us realize how much we like to walk around half-dressed and how badly we need to put up curtains (to keep from scaring all the neighbors). But I don't want just any curtains, and a part of me wants to have curtains made while I'm in Cambodia. Which means I'll need fabric, which means I'll need to find time somewhere in the next 4 days to find some...<br /><br />Luckily, amidst all the craziness of the past few weeks, I've had a secret weapon which has helped me stay sane: the peppermint white mocha. It's a completely over-the-top beverage, but I love how it's seasonal and how it reminds me that, like most everything else (crazy busy schedules included), it'll only last for so long.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQpbJzvI/AAAAAAAAE9o/9rLDZ3qW_Vs/s1600/red%2Brock.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 268px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQpbJzvI/AAAAAAAAE9o/9rLDZ3qW_Vs/s400/red%2Brock.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557823756707679986\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/dHFMpy\">Red Rock</a>'s peppermint white mocha<br /><br /></span></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQrddeTI/AAAAAAAAE9g/LK87__h-s7A/s1600/los%2Bgatos%2Bgreat%2Bbear%2Bcoffee.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 267px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQrddeTI/AAAAAAAAE9g/LK87__h-s7A/s400/los%2Bgatos%2Bgreat%2Bbear%2Bcoffee.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557823757254228274\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http://bit.ly/dOKAgL\">Great Bear</a>'s peppermint white mocha</span><br /><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQFVDQdI/AAAAAAAAE9Y/UIv7cqgJd0w/s1600/starbucks.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 268px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TSFbQFVDQdI/AAAAAAAAE9Y/UIv7cqgJd0w/s400/starbucks.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557823747018408402\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Starbucks' peppermint white mocha</span><br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8323481029747474572/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
