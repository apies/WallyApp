Did you have a good weekend? These are the flowers I had on my desk to motivate me to finally do my taxes, haha. Alan and I also watched the entire season of Game of Thronesâ€”we were instantly hooked after the first episode!

Are you as excited about the second season as I am?","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/969118113482838677/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
