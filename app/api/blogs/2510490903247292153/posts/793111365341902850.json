They weren't that sweet and would go really well with a side of Devonshire cream or jam.  <div><br /></div><div>p.s. buttermilk is my new favorite ingredient to cook with.<br /><div><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TPHdAnRxw5c/TjYQZlLoljI/AAAAAAAAJCE/FvaaP2Is0D4/s1600/scones%2B2.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TPHdAnRxw5c/TjYQZlLoljI/AAAAAAAAJCE/FvaaP2Is0D4/s1600/scones%2B2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5635710015364437554\" /></a><br /></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/793111365341902850/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
