Not that we have any exciting secrets squirreled away back there. Mostly it's because our bedroom looks sad and undone. When I moved back to the Bay, I left my bed frame in L.A. and said I would get a new one after I got settled in here. That was five years ago. Five! We've been sleeping on our mattress on the floor now for as long as I can remember. It started to seem like we'd be sleeping on the ground for another five years if I didn't do something about it soon, so a bedroom makeover is now one of my new projects. While searching for new bedding, I found these colorful confetti sheets. They're sold out of our size sheets, but I can't stop thinking about them. Wouldn't it be fun to wake up to a party in your bed every morning?&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">(sheets by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IeO4AU\" target=\"_blank\">Plover Organic</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IMjulK\" target=\"_blank\">The Company Store</a>)</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6878762760011660917/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
