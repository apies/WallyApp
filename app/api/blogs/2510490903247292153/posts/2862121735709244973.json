Hong Kong and Cambodia were loads of fun. I have so many adventures and pictures to share! My computer/camera/photo transfer decided to crap out on me today, so stay tuned as I (hopefully) get all my pictures uploaded and sorted.

They will be so perfect for my next batch of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/eRy34U\">French onion soup</a> -- thanks Preet!","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2862121735709244973/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
