I knew my brain was on the verge of overheating when I woke up on Saturday and the first thing I did was start worrying about when I was going to take my car in for its tune-up (among a gazillion--trust me, a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gazillion--</span> other inane things). When I start feeling this level of anxiety creep over me, I try to make it a point to remind myself to relax and that my car is not actually going to blow up if it goes another day or two un-tuned.  This weekend I found the best combination of things to do should another worry-wart attack/heat wave pop up again. Here are three of my favorite things to do that are guaranteed to calm even the most frazzled nerves (and keep you cool):<br /><br />1) Have tea with a friend. Iced tea at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/bXXeJ1\">Lovejoy's</a> (pictured above) is particularly refreshing on hot days. Their cozy ambiance and scones with Devonshire cream make me want to linger here for hours.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArocn9REI/AAAAAAAAEdQ/19VVovaXCGI/s1600/magazines.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArocn9REI/AAAAAAAAEdQ/19VVovaXCGI/s1600/magazines.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5521461117034775618\" border=\"0\" /></a>2) Catch up on all your favorite magazines. I love these ones :)<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArn3vVIxI/AAAAAAAAEdI/lvenbosIIb4/s1600/ocean.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArn3vVIxI/AAAAAAAAEdI/lvenbosIIb4/s1600/ocean.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5521461107133588242\" border=\"0\" /></a>3) Visit the ocean. Wading into the icy cold water one foot at a time was such a thrill--I couldn't stop laughing, it was so cold!<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArnihpw2I/AAAAAAAAEdA/jBJtEovJ64Q/s1600/under+the+pier.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKArnihpw2I/AAAAAAAAEdA/jBJtEovJ64Q/s1600/under+the+pier.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5521461101439075170\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><blockquote></blockquote>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/376447907461326504/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
