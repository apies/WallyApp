Growing up, my family would watch Home Alone every year, and I can't believe it still hasn't gotten old. Here's a list of my other favorites: Love Actually, Die Hard, Elf, Sleepless in Seattle, Home Alone and Edward Scissorhands. They make me feel warm and cozy every time. I plan on watching a few of these (and maybe a couple of new ones) while wrapping gifts this weekend. If you have any other recommendations, I'd love to hear. :)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7644497966660429874/comments"},"labels":["Friday Flicks","To See"]}
