I'm still hoping that the nearby retirement community will take me seriously and let us move in, but people keep telling me not to hold my breath. I did, however, hold my breath for this French onion soup tonight which took nearly two hours to simmer, but was worth every second. It has tender onions, white wine, toasted bread and piles of gruyere. It was <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">amazing</span>. Probably the best soup I have ever had. And I didn't even think that I liked french onion soup!<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPyL1mOzJLI/AAAAAAAAEzc/isU1tiXqLHg/s1600/french%2Bonion%2Bsoup.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPyL1mOzJLI/AAAAAAAAEzc/isU1tiXqLHg/s1600/french%2Bonion%2Bsoup.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5547462593925555378\" border=\"0\" /></a>We used <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hgkRCZ\">this recipe</a> and followed her advice and used a generous amount of wine.
