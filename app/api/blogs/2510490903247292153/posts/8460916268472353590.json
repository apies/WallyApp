I hope you have a cozy day with lots of mashed potatoes and the people you love the most. Are you cooking dinner or did you sign up for a side dish? I'm bringing our favorite&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/hNE38Z\" target=\"_blank\">homemade bread</a> and dessert. I got the recipe for this pumpkin cake from my friend Lauren, and I promise you it's the moistest, easiest pumpkin cake recipe ever. So, for anyone still in need of something to bring to dinner, this can be made in under an hour with ingredients you probably already have in your pantry.<br />\n<br />\nAnd last, but not least, thank you <i>so</i> much for reading Quiet Like Horsesâ€”I am truly grateful for all your support!<br />\n<br />\n<b>One-Bowl Pumpkin Cake</b><br />\nBy Lauren<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n2 &nbsp;cups flour<br />\n1/2 tsp. salt<br />\n2 &nbsp;tsp. baking powder<br />\n1 &nbsp;tsp. baking soda<br />\n2 &nbsp;tsp. cinnamon<br />\n1/4 tsp. cloves (optional)<br />\n1 tsp. nutmeg (optional)<br />\n2 cups sugar<br />\n1 cup canola or vegetable oil<br />\n4 eggs<br />\n2 cups pumpkin (1 small can)<br />\n<br />\nAdd all cake ingredients in a large bowl and beat for 2 minutes or until well blended. Pour into greased and floured 11x13 pan and bake at 350 degrees for about 30 min or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. (Alternatively, line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy removal from pan).<br />\n<br />\n<b>Cream Cheese Frosting</b><br />\n1 pkg cream cheese (8 oz. at room temp)<br />\n3/4 stick butter (room temp)<br />\n1 tsp. vanilla<br />\n1-2 tbsp milk<br />\n2 cups powdered sugar (adjust the sugar to suit your taste; I cut it in half)<br />\n<br />\nBeat cream cheese and butter in bowl. Add vanilla and milk and beat until well blended. &nbsp;Slowly add powdered sugar. Frost cooled cake and cut into squares to serve.<br />\n<br />\nNote: the cake and frosting can be made a day in advance. Wrap the cooled cake in plastic wrap and place frosting in an airtight container. Store both in the fridge and remove when ready to assemble. Let the frosting come to room temperature and re-beat with electric mixer until smooth. Frost cake and cut into squares.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8460916268472353590/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
