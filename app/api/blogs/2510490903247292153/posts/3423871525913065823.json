This year I found inspiration in delicately carved <a href=\"http://bit.ly/9bAwRb\">lace-patterned pumpkins</a> (I've been in love with these for so long now) and the forest scene pumpkin from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/bNP98H\">Sweet Paul Magazine</a> (I almost fell out of my seat when I saw it! It reminds me of the dioramas I'd make as a kid).<br /><br />I decided to do some good ol' fashioned carving on my pumpkin this year and decided to carve out the Quiet Like Horses' leaf design from the header image (with a spider hanging from its web because c'mon, it's Halloween). I haven't carved in a long, long time which might explain why my carving took such a long, long time. It took most of the evening, and the next day, even my triceps and hand muscles were sore -- who knew carving could be so taxing? :P It does look quite pretty when lit up at night though, if I do say so myself.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TL5hVusoP6I/AAAAAAAAEk8/Mu2LOktVLQk/s1600/carved+pumpin.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 500px; height: 333px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TL5hVusoP6I/AAAAAAAAEk8/Mu2LOktVLQk/s1600/carved+pumpin.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5529964418397912994\" border=\"0\" /></a>Bottom pumpkin images: Country Living <a href=\"http://bit.ly/b7NEh7\">gilded pumpkins</a> via Happy Mundane, Real Simple <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cwJSQK\">plaid pumpkins</a>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"5","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3423871525913065823/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
