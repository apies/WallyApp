I had grand visions of cooking everyone all my favorite dishes, but in the end, the two days flew by and as quick as everyone had arrived, they were gone again. It always takes me a little bit to re-adjust to the quiet after having the hustle and bustle of a full house. So to cheer myself up, I decided to bake one of my favorite fall treats: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/cg3kuD\">pumpkin bread</a>. I was excited about this recipe because of its \"vein\" of cream cheese filling running through the center of the loaf. I wasn't expecting it to really be just a vein of cream cheese, but it truly, sadly was. Next time, I'll double the amount of the filling to get a \"thick ribbon\" of cream cheese instead. (A ribbon of cream cheese sounds so much more appetizing than a vein of it, don't you think?)<br /><br />This bread was moist, cinnamony-pumpkiny, and felt like a warm bear hug. It cheered me right up.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGdJ29jGI/AAAAAAAAEfc/-U5I0zffbyA/s1600/eggs.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGdJ29jGI/AAAAAAAAEfc/-U5I0zffbyA/s1600/eggs.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524023884623219810\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGc2UMuCI/AAAAAAAAEfU/DxFQtJ92LWQ/s1600/spices.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGc2UMuCI/AAAAAAAAEfU/DxFQtJ92LWQ/s1600/spices.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524023879377139746\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGcaTxgYI/AAAAAAAAEfM/TBfRs9J6_sg/s1600/loaf.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGcaTxgYI/AAAAAAAAEfM/TBfRs9J6_sg/s1600/loaf.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524023871859163522\" border=\"0\" /></a><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGb_vh4SI/AAAAAAAAEfE/s0gxfenoxyY/s1600/cream+cheese+layer.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 435px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TKlGb_vh4SI/AAAAAAAAEfE/s0gxfenoxyY/s1600/cream+cheese+layer.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5524023864727822626\" border=\"0\" /></a>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/908211670107514616/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
