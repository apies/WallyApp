To ask her, he got a block of ice, drilled a hole in it, and stuck a series of notes inside. When she pulled it out, the first note said \"Now that we've broken the ice...\" followed by \"Will you go to prom with me!?\" with each word strung together. Isn't that cute?<br />\n<br />\nDo you remember how you were asked? Or were you the one who did the asking? I had to ask two boys! The first one ditched me a week before the dance because he \"didn't want to lead me on.\" (He was convinced I was in love with him which was <i>so</i> far from the truth. Please. I only had eyes for my honors chem lab partner who was a bad boy with tattoos and who talked back to the teacher, but who, unfortunately, already had a girlfriend.) I ended up asking the class clown from French class instead.<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ovrTUDDao6A/T6tPIWcPnII/AAAAAAAANgs/gig0vmohHkc/s1600/dresses1-1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"pretty vintage dresses \" border=\"0\" height=\"661\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ovrTUDDao6A/T6tPIWcPnII/AAAAAAAANgs/gig0vmohHkc/s1600/dresses1-1.jpg\" title=\"pretty vintage dresses \" width=\"450\" /></a></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CNAfnZaQkyM/T6tPJnu3ChI/AAAAAAAANg8/IYXtrCcVvHU/s1600/dancing.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img alt=\"dancing queen\" border=\"0\" height=\"676\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CNAfnZaQkyM/T6tPJnu3ChI/AAAAAAAANg8/IYXtrCcVvHU/s1600/dancing.jpg\" title=\"dancing queen\" width=\"450\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n</div>\n(second image by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/KRZlWr\" target=\"_blank\">oh hello friend</a>, third image via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/Jf9n9Q\" target=\"_blank\">artymiss</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7335111962045607052/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
