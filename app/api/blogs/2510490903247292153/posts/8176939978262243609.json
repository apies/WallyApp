Did you have a good one? I hope so. My mom called me the day before Mother's Day because she thought Mother's Day was on Saturday and not Sunday. Not that she was trying to trick me or anything, but that's just how little she could care about the holiday. (Aside from not knowing the date, here she is calling <i>me</i> to wish <i>me</i> a good day.) Her disinterest in Hallmark holidays is one of the many reasons why I love her. Another thing about my mom that I'm thankful for is how taught me to love my vegetables. <div><br /></div><div>Now, in all these years, I've always stir-fried my veggies or eaten them raw (which is how my mom served us vegetables growing up). Scarred from all the grey string beans and limp pieces of broccoli I had eaten at friends' houses or in the cafeteria throughout my childhood, as an adult, the idea of boiling vegetables repulsed me. Could it ever result in vegetables that weren't sad and tasteless? I doubted it.<div><br /></div><div>While flipping through my borrowed copy of Ad Hoc, I came across Thomas Keller's broccolini salad with burrata cheese. I love both things, especially the creamy decadence of burrata (have you had it? If you like fresh mozzarella, please go out and try it. I promise you'll love it). In the recipe he calls for blanching the broccolini, which I had heard of and seen done on the Food Network, but had always clumped into the 'boiling=sad &amp; limp vegetables' category. I was just about to turn the page to find another recipe when I read his whole explanation about the blanching process and how it results in bright green, perfectly tender-crisp vegetables. I was sold. It does take a wee bit of patience (and you have to make an ice bath to plunge your vegetables into) but it really does make for a very well-cooked vegetable--gorgeous bright green, crisp to the bite, and uniformly seasoned.     <div><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ruYJ66ii_Rg/TcdfVMeuIPI/AAAAAAAAGpE/SbGrW7qgCdA/s1600/salt%2B.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 365px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ruYJ66ii_Rg/TcdfVMeuIPI/AAAAAAAAGpE/SbGrW7qgCdA/s1600/salt%2B.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604553079017840882\" /></a><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ptf0ATyDynA/TcdfUdT6jnI/AAAAAAAAGo0/Db8fiP0B7M8/s1600/plated.jpg\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604553066356051570\" /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JLDxLsFTMcA/TcdfUNNczlI/AAAAAAAAGos/c4WzFH7aHm4/s1600/burratta.jpg\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604553062033968722\" /></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vK_XJ7OWbUo/Tcdgffemc7I/AAAAAAAAGpU/fj2JWLWFAxY/s1600/blanching.jpg\" style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 372px;\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5604554355427931058\" /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Broccolini Salad with Burrata Cheese</b></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><br /></b></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">2 pounds broccolini </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">3 large cremini mushrooms, about 2 inches in diameter (I left these out just 'cause I didn't feel like buying a whole carton of them only to use 3)</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1 red onion</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1 cup black Cerignola olives, or other cured olives (I used other cured olives because I was not near a gourmet grocery store at the time.

Prepare an ice bath. Set a cooling rack over a baking sheet and line the rack with paper towels. </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br />With a paring knife, cut off the thick ends of the broccolini stalks and peel the remaining stalks. Blanch the broccolini in batches in the boiling water until crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the ice bath to stop the cooking, and drain on the paper towels. </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Cut off the stems of the mushrooms flush with the caps and discard. Cut the caps into paper-thin slices using a Japanese mandoline or other vegetable slicer or by hand, and transfer to a small bowl.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Cut the onion in half through the equator. Slice one half of the onion into paper-thin rings on the mandoline. Select about 20 of the nicest rings, and reserve the remaining onion for another use.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Cut the flesh of the olives away from the pit.

Line up the broccolini stalks side by side on the parchment paper (this will allow you to dress and season the broccolini evenly), drizzle with about 1/4 cup of the vinaigrette, and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Toss the mushroom slices with about 2 tablespoons of the vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper (do not overdress the mushrooms).</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Cut away the top nub of the burrata and put it in a shallow serving bowl that just holds it. Holding a pair of scissors vertically, snip an X into the top of the burrata, reaching the soft center. Open the top slightly and drizzle olive oil over and around the cheese. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and pepper, and place on serving platter.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Arrange the broccolini, mushrooms, olives, and onions on the platter.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Serves 6</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Sherry Vinaigrette</b></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4 cup sherry wine vinegar</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1/4 cup red wine vinegar</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1 to 1 1/2 cups extra virgin olive oil</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">Whisk the two vinegars in a bowl, then whisk in about 1 cup of the olive oil in a steady stream.
