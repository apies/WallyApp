It was from the photographer Stephanie Congdon Barnes who said simply: \"You can have the life you want.\" When I read it, this vision popped into my head of what I'd want my beautiful life to look like. One small thing that kind of stuck was that I want to be the woman who curls her hair for work. It's not groundbreaking or life-changing by any means, but it's one of those fun little things I always say I'll do but never actually get around to. So this week I decided to be that woman, even if it was just for one day. I think it'll be fun to have mermaid hair on a regular work day. What big or little things would you have in your beautiful life? I'd love to hear.<br />\n<br />\np.s. I've been obsessed with trying to perfect <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HTr0ER\" target=\"_blank\">these curls</a>. Don't you just want to run your hands all through that?&nbsp; <br />\n<br />\n<i>{And a big thanks to my friend Roy for snapping these pictures!}</i>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7297617646764324329/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
