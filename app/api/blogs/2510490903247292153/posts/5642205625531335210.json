I'd learn to deal without running water and would trek a few miles to the nearest water source to fetch the day's water supply. In this splendid <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Survivor</span>-esque dreamworld, I hadn't given a second thought to bugs or lizards or any of the wild things that were very likely to be waiting underfoot for me, and the idea of squatter toilets never phased me. I thought then that of course it would be hard, but surely not that hard, and best of all, it would be a satisfying experience. So it was funny when, halfway through the trip, I found myself not harvesting the fields in preparation for that night's dinner, but happily lying in a hammock reading the latest issue of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Marie Claire</span>. The Secretary of State was related to someone we knew, and there we all were, doing nothing but relaxing in his 2-story, 4-bedroom beach house which he graciously let us stay in for our 3-day trip to Kep.<br /><br />A vacation destination for many local city dwellers, Kep is well-known for its beaches and resorts. After so much rushing around the week before (there were temples to see! and aunts to meet!), the slow pace of the town was a welcome change. In fact, Kep was one of my favorite parts of the entire trip.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUehiiz18wI/AAAAAAAAFC0/i7xnEEhb1vA/s400/photo%25282%2529.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 300px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUehiiz18wI/AAAAAAAAFC0/i7xnEEhb1vA/s400/photo%25282%2529.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597079098782466\" border=\"0\" /></a>During the day, we'd go for a swim. <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ijhhUh\">Veranda</a> resort had my favorite pool, tucked in among the hills, which had smooth rocks and wood benches you could sit on in the middle of the water. It was a nice way to keep cool and spend an afternoon reading.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiCpszgZI/AAAAAAAAFEE/Sb5rdxqCOPU/s1600/veranda%2Brestaurant.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiCpszgZI/AAAAAAAAFEE/Sb5rdxqCOPU/s1600/veranda%2Brestaurant.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597630704124306\" border=\"0\" /></a>In the evening, we dined at the Veranda restaurant which felt like a great big, lit-up tree house.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiFzAV9vI/AAAAAAAAFEM/0EPoVKoyd84/s1600/wine.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiFzAV9vI/AAAAAAAAFEM/0EPoVKoyd84/s1600/wine.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597684741601010\" border=\"0\" /></a>After dinner, we would sit outside by the beach and drink wine.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh48tzsJI/AAAAAAAAFDU/IWsD6uDmQG0/s1600/dessert.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh48tzsJI/AAAAAAAAFDU/IWsD6uDmQG0/s1600/dessert.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597464009912466\" border=\"0\" /></a>Or we'd go for dessert while putting in requests to the karaoke singers on stage to sing our favorite songs.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh4sFhS3I/AAAAAAAAFDE/K307EFPhB1I/s1600/banana%2Bdessert.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh4sFhS3I/AAAAAAAAFDE/K307EFPhB1I/s1600/banana%2Bdessert.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597459545967474\" border=\"0\" /></a>(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">traditional banana and tapioca dessert in sweet coconut milk)<br /><br /></span></div><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiB3C0DQI/AAAAAAAAFDk/HWaMS3Mzkvg/s1600/DSC_0797.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiB3C0DQI/AAAAAAAAFDk/HWaMS3Mzkvg/s1600/DSC_0797.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597617106226434\" border=\"0\" /></a>At the beach, we'd feel the soft, white sand between our toes and splash in the see-through water.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh4yGPlSI/AAAAAAAAFDM/bSXk7s7TV10/s1600/boat%2Brides.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh4yGPlSI/AAAAAAAAFDM/bSXk7s7TV10/s1600/boat%2Brides.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597461159613730\" border=\"0\" /></a>We'd take boat rides to go on adventures to Rabbit Island (which sorta looked a lot like the set of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lost)</span>...<br /><br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiCD-UFeI/AAAAAAAAFD0/oL7kN_LATW8/s1600/kampot%2Bpepper%2Bcrab.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeiCD-UFeI/AAAAAAAAFD0/oL7kN_LATW8/s1600/kampot%2Bpepper%2Bcrab.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597620577015266\" border=\"0\" /></a>...where we ate the freshest crabs (caught right in front of us!) that we all agreed were probably the tastiest crabs we'd ever eaten.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh5BHXOeI/AAAAAAAAFDc/_ccGmyF6Vl4/s1600/docks%2Bthat%2Bgo%2Bon.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TUeh5BHXOeI/AAAAAAAAFDc/_ccGmyF6Vl4/s1600/docks%2Bthat%2Bgo%2Bon.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5568597465190840802\" border=\"0\" /></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(walking down one of many docks that go on and on)</span><br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5642205625531335210/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
