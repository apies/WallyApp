I rushed around in the evenings in order to get to bed by 11 (my ambitious new goal) and made it there by midnight on Tuesday and 11:30 on Wednesday. Once in bed, however, drifting off to sleep became a challenge. Instead, I would lay awake thinking about the inconsequential moments of the week. Like the way the rain seemed to pause as Nathalie and I drove under overpasses on our way home from the surprisingly calm and empty outlets. I thought about the future and all that I'm grateful for. Even though I know Thanksgiving is usually the time when people give thanks, I feel most thankful around this time, when we are in the middle of such an amazing season and when we begin anticipating the bright and shiny promise of a new year.<br /><br />I am thankful for everyone who visits this space, I am thankful for Nathalie for taking pictures of me when I <s>am usually</s> can be super awkward in front of the camera, and I am thankful for being continuously inspired by bloggers and friends alike. And also, this week, I am thankful for the awesome finds I scored at the Renegade Craft Fair, like this <a href=\"http://etsy.me/gWOZO5\">Noble Town Vintage</a> necklace and Seablanket top.<br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><div style=\"text-align: left;\"><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRRWtuzaT8I/AAAAAAAAE7M/KmmQg4LYk_g/s1600/from%2Brenegade%2Bcraft%2Bfair.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TRRWtuzaT8I/AAAAAAAAE7M/KmmQg4LYk_g/s1600/from%2Brenegade%2Bcraft%2Bfair.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5554159584112431042\" border=\"0\" /></a><br />p.s.
