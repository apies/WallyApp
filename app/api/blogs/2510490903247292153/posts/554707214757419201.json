What makes them awesome is they serve small plates so you can order a bunch of dishes to share. For my birthday, Alan took me to dinner at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/QaM6Zj\" target=\"_blank\">Izakaya Sozai</a> in San Francisco (in the ridiculously foggy Inner Sunset neighborhood where people were wearing scarves and beanies)! I'd heard good things about it and was excited to try everything.<br />\n<br />\nTo start, we ordered the takoyaki—a ball-shaped snack made with chopped up octopus and fried in a flavorful batter—simply because everyone else around us was getting it. I've never had it before, but it was delightful. My other favorites were the bacon-wrapped mochi, the Chilean sea bass, and the tofu steak and mixed mushrooms served on a sizzling platter. I wanted to drench everything in that mushroom butter sauce.<br />\n<br />\nAlan, who is never impressed with any of the izakayas we've been to, had an amazing time. We both agreed it was all so good. The restaurant itself is teensy-tiny, but since our party was just Alan and me, it felt nice and intimate. <br />\n<br />\n<b>Have you ever been to an izakaya?
