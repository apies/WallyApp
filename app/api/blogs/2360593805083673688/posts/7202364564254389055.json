We don't plan anything elaborate except for maybe where we'll park and a general idea of what we'd like to see. Other than that, we just show up, get out of the car, and walk around. Usually we'll walk leisurely, but almost always we'll walk for at least a few hours. This is always the best because: </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r<br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">1. Being outside is fun. (And once I read about a study that said people who spend more time outdoors are less likely to get sick, but I could just be making this up.)</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">2. The methodical act of walking is both relaxing and rejuvenating.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">3. You see so many cool things while walking that would go unnoticed if you were simply zooming by in a car.</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">4. You have time to <i>really</i> talk to the person you're with. </div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">5. It's free and can be done almost anywhere!</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">\r<br /></div><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3yEJly-RwfI/TlSVzo5erII/AAAAAAAAJR0/BI1c8Mq4C-o/s1600/blackberries.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 895px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3yEJly-RwfI/TlSVzo5erII/AAAAAAAAJR0/BI1c8Mq4C-o/s1600/blackberries.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5644300947386444930\" /></a>This weekend we went to San Francisco and walked around the Presidio.

The beach in the City has never lived up to my idea of what a beach should be (with sun and people swimming in bathing suits), but it was fun to sit and rest for a while and watch the massive ships sail across the ocean towards the Golden Gate Bridge...</div><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YLjU4OYDnuk/TlSVEYTyVCI/AAAAAAAAJRQ/zFunuHughlY/s1600/8.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YLjU4OYDnuk/TlSVEYTyVCI/AAAAAAAAJRQ/zFunuHughlY/s1600/8.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5644300135479530530\" /></a>...and slip quietly underneath through to the other side. </div><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-idjc3seVZcI/TlSU7IIpCTI/AAAAAAAAJRI/2TxIU2Y31fw/s1600/adventurous.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-idjc3seVZcI/TlSU7IIpCTI/AAAAAAAAJRI/2TxIU2Y31fw/s1600/adventurous.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5644299976518994226\" /></a>Everyone on the beach was all wrapped up, except for these adventurous kids.

They live in Russian Hill, a crazy hilly area where parking is hard to come by. We finally found parking at the very tip top of this hill and my heart raced a bit thinking about tumbling over, but Alan had it all under control. And then, there was this beautiful view.   </div><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YuP3bViAGy8/TlSUPpLlTiI/AAAAAAAAJQw/WKC4yBEDmXo/s1600/gialina.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YuP3bViAGy8/TlSUPpLlTiI/AAAAAAAAJQw/WKC4yBEDmXo/s1600/gialina.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5644299229475458594\" /></a>After our visit, we walked down a set of stairs in the neighborhood to North Beach (where all the Italian restaurants are), but since neither of us could decide where to eat, we ended up at our <a href=\"http://bit.ly/qgr3l6\">favorite pizza place</a> on the way home. </div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7202364564254389055/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
