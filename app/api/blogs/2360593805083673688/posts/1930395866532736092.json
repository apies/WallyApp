For me, fall revolves around dressing in warm sweaters, scarves, and boots with either <a href=\"http://bit.ly/qSRFaH\">simple gold jewelry</a> or big, fun statement pieces to balance all of fall's earthy tones. Here's what I'm looking forward to doing the most and the pieces that would be the perfect way to usher in this new season:<br />\n<br />\n*Making soups and homemade bread and having friends over to eat it with. Perfect host outfit: these cheerful flats and pretty drusy bracelet.<br />\n*Painting pumpkins. Last year, we carved pumpkins and they quickly (and sadly) turned into mush. This year we're skipping the carving altogether and painting our pumpkins instead. This tweed blazer and dainty gold ring&nbsp;from ShopNBC would be fun to scope out pumpkins in at the pumpkin patch.<br />\n*Getting ready for the holiday season and dressing in bows, sequins and pearls.<br />\n*Catching up on good books, drinking pumpkin lattes, and wearing wool shorts, tights, and bold cocktail rings.<br />\n<br />\nWhat are you most excited about this fall?<br />\n<br />\n<i><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: x-small;\">(This post is in partnership with ShopNBC.
