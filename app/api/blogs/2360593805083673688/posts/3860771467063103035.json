I slept, I moped, and in between I'd crave some really tasty soup. Then something amazing happened. Something that I thought only happened to other girls, the lucky ones with perfect hair and cute sneezes.  A beautiful <s>man</s> red Le Creuset dutch oven got down on one knee and asked me if we could be together forever. A few happy tears slid down my cheeks, but of course I said yes--I've had my eye on a Le Creuset dutch oven <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">forever. </span></span>They're so pretty, and they cook up some serious magic. I finally decided to make the investment, and while I've only cooked one thing so far, the potato soup I made this weekend made it all worth it. (Although I've had my eye on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/\">this recipe</a> for a looong time and can't wait to make it!)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDn1fH2NI/AAAAAAAAEsE/ALCXW7m5cs4/s1600/potatoes.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDn1fH2NI/AAAAAAAAEsE/ALCXW7m5cs4/s1600/potatoes.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5537038987271067858\" border=\"0\" /></a>It all started with some good-sized potatoes.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDnbn57FI/AAAAAAAAEr0/Sb5HZblVssQ/s1600/spices.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 399px; height: 613px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDnbn57FI/AAAAAAAAEr0/Sb5HZblVssQ/s1600/spices.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5537038980328582226\" border=\"0\" /></a>And a mix of tarragon, cilantro, and celery. I've never had tarragon before, I don't like celery, and cilantro in a potato soup sounded odd to me, but in the end everything just came together perfectly.<br /><br />Now, this recipe is not for the faint of heart, so look away for a second if you're squeamish...

But in the bacon's defense, a whole lotta soup was being made.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDnExzMxI/AAAAAAAAErk/UM1MMm8RmUI/s1600/600x382+soup.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 381px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNeDnExzMxI/AAAAAAAAErk/UM1MMm8RmUI/s1600/600x382+soup.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5537038974196069138\" border=\"0\" /></a>In the end, this soup was such a satisfying, hearty dish that definitely makes staying home with a cold not quite so bad.<br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup</span><br />Adapted, just a bit, from Karena's recipe <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ddhBxq\">here</a><br /><br />Yield: 6 to 8 servings<br /><br /><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">1 pound bacon, chopped</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">2 stalks celery, diced</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">1 onion, chopped</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">6-8 cloves garlic, minced</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">6-7 large russet potatoes, cubed (The original recipe calls for peeled potatoes, but I left the skins on because I like the texture and the way it makes the soup look so cozy and rustic. But mostly I left them on because I was lazy.)<br /></div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</div>        <div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">3 tablespoons butter</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">1/4 cup all-purpose flour</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">1 cup heavy cream</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">1 teaspoon dried tarragon</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</div><div style=\"margin: 0px 8px 4px 0px;\">salt and pepper to taste<br /><br /><span class=\"plaincharacterwrap break\">In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon  over medium heat until done. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain  off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.                <br /><br /></span><span class=\"plaincharacterwrap break\">In the bacon grease remaining in  the pan, saute the celery and onion until onion begins to turn clear.  Add the garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cubed  potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return the bacon  to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes.  Cover, and simmer (about 25-30 minutes) until potatoes are tender.                <br /><br /></span><span class=\"plaincharacterwrap break\">In a separate pan, melt the  butter over medium heat.  Whisk in the flour. Cook stirring constantly,   for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon and cilantro.  Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until  thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about  1/2 the soup (I just used a potato masher because I'm old-fashioned like that), and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.<br /><br />I also added a bit of milk at the end since the consistency was a bit too thick. Then I garnished with parmesan because everything tastes better with it, and some fresh chopped chives. (Chives + Potatoes = So Good)<br /></span></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"7","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3860771467063103035/comments"}}
