When it became clear that Denise trusted me to do whatever the heck I wanted, I was <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">beside myself</span>. (But nervous at the same time -- I really wanted her and her hubs to like the room!) I was given a budget of $500, but because I like challenges, I gave myself a self-imposed budget of $450. After weeks of scouring vintage stores, Etsy, big box stores, and designer stores (for inspiration) for all the perfect pieces, I ended up spending a total of just $442! Now, depending on where you stand in life on home decor, that may seem like a lot, but given the fact that I have friends who have spent that much on a single mirror or chair, I think that is pretty darn good. The only thing that's not part of that $442 is the mattress and box spring (they already had those ;).<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNDYEkYep4I/AAAAAAAAEqU/yb2tlldBKNM/s1600/shelf+decor.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNDYEkYep4I/AAAAAAAAEqU/yb2tlldBKNM/s1600/shelf+decor.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5535161515035764610\" border=\"0\" /></a>I created an inspiration board of what I wanted the room to look and feel like. Then I turned my attention to finding and buying similar items at more affordable stores like Target and Ikea. And while buying home decor from big box stores like these are nothing to turn your nose up at, I do think it's important to also add a balance by finishing the room off with some unique pieces to show off your personal style. (I'm not going to lie--buying framed art from Ikea makes me shudder). Here, I got the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dylW86\">snowy partridges</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/9qTOiL\">yellow leaves photograph</a> from Etsy. And I spent a good while walking back and forth through the used book store searching for the right colored books (I know, I was so shamelessly judging books by their covers--I've never felt so devious!)<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNDYEBmE0jI/AAAAAAAAEqM/BaEkmNK4Mk8/s1600/night+stand.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TNDYEBmE0jI/AAAAAAAAEqM/BaEkmNK4Mk8/s1600/night+stand.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5535161505697550898\" border=\"0\" /></a>I have always wanted to use a tray table as a bedside table -- <a href=\"http://bit.ly/dty9Ok\">this one</a> from CB2 works quite lovely. This urn vase is from a vintage store nearby.
