Since they were at a Japanese restaurant, one of the guys—whose first language was not English—ordered tako (octopus). In between taking huge bites, he couldn't stop talking about how much he loved it, but he kept calling it the wrong name. He was enjoying himself so much, she couldn't bring herself to correct him, so for the rest of the lunch, he kept asking <i>if she wanted any of his octopussy</i>. I laugh every time I think about it.<br />\n<br />\nHave you had any awkward/funny lunch moments? I wish they happened to me more often!<br />\n<br />\n(photo by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/OryGrS\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Graydon</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/75558943459715717/comments"},"labels":["office talk","To See"]}
