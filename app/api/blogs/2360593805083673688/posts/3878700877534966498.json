There's the buff lady across the street who is always out either watering her lawn or washing her car. She has one black cat that is <a href=\"http://bit.ly/x7feJv\" target=\"_blank\">groomed like a lion</a>&nbsp;and feeds about 10 other strays. There's a mom on the corner who is a smoker and who looks suspicious of everyone even though she sometimes leaves her baby out in the yard by himself. And next door to us, there's a woman who sits for hours in her front window typing out a long tragic novel. She also owns one cat (not groomed like a lion, just ordinarily groomed) and feeds the 10 neighborhood strays. I know less about the people further down the street and almost nothing about the people around the corner.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSometimes I think about how fun it must have been when everyone knew their neighbors and block parties were a normal thing. (Didn't they look fun and full of good things like potato salad?) I'm so happy our friends Ali and Elijah live less than a mile away because they feel like the kind of good neighbors everyone should have. In the past few weeks, our neighborly activities have included: going on a walk, borrowing a hand saw, going over for coffee, and sharing treats. A few days ago, Ali left a package of cookies at our door since we weren't home. She texted me \"enjoy your evening. p.s. 6 cats watched me drop it off and they slowly began circling in. I have no idea what'll happen between when I left and when you arrive.\" Sometimes those cats are the creepiest neighbors of all.<br />\n<br />\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-__FPxjW0HsI/TwP8SoLytRI/AAAAAAAAMks/5PguhTnj-pM/s1600/afternoon+coffee.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-__FPxjW0HsI/TwP8SoLytRI/AAAAAAAAMks/5PguhTnj-pM/s1600/afternoon+coffee.jpg\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">{late morning coffee at Ali and Elijah's}</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yHFn3cX9C2E/TwP8Tih8pGI/AAAAAAAAMk0/siDN1YsNzlc/s1600/espresso%2521.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yHFn3cX9C2E/TwP8Tih8pGI/AAAAAAAAMk0/siDN1YsNzlc/s1600/espresso%2521.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">{their fancy new Nespresso machineâ€”isn't it pretty?}</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nvlOjNKBwlo/TwP8UQkGjZI/AAAAAAAAMk8/MI2nqCGP_vo/s1600/peppermint+bark.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nvlOjNKBwlo/TwP8UQkGjZI/AAAAAAAAMk8/MI2nqCGP_vo/s1600/peppermint+bark.jpg\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">{peppermint bark gift to thank them for their general jolliness}</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />\n</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">(block party images via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/w37AQF\" target=\"_blank\">Colonial Hills History</a>)</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3878700877534966498/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
