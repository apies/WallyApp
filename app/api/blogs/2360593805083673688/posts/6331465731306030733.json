Alan told me he wanted to go to dinner with his CEO and his wife and that he wanted me to come. At first, I panicked. I mean, the CEO and his wife? These are real adults we're talking about. Going to dinner with adults (who aren't our parents) was on my to-do list for when I grew up. (As is buying a house, having kids, seriously remembering to take my multivitamins, etc.) Then I remembered I'm almost 30, which, one might say, is a pretty solid adult age, and I wondered if I'll ever feel like a real adult. What do you think? For all you adults out there, do you feel your age?","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6331465731306030733/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
