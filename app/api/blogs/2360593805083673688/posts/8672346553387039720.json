I won't go into the details just yet, but what I will say is that they were exciting enough to warrant a fancy dinner out. I've been wanting to eat at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/nrSt47\">Nick's on Main</a> in Los Gatos for forever, and even though it's not Gary Danko's by any means, it was a place I'd been saving to visit until an occasion such as this. I'd heard that they are always booked, so when I called last Thursday night about possibly squeezing in that same evening, I wasn't expecting much. But Nick, the man himself, picked up and said they had a reservation for 8 p.m.! I swiped on some lipstick and Alan put on a nice shirt and away we went. <div>\r<br /></div><div>It's a teeny tiny restaurant that feels hip on the inside and charming when looking in from the outside. Everyone was drinking wine when we got there which was a little intimidating, but we were soon seated and the party for our mouths began. To start with, we went with the \"Trust the Chef,\" which is whatever the chef feels like making you. Since I love surprises, it was a fun choice, but I was a little disappointed when the dish came out and there were two small bowls of what looked like nothing much. Well, it turned out to be the best foie gras I've ever had. It came with sweet, warm cherries which were a really lovely contrast to the delicate, smooth mousse. This was possibly my favorite dish of the entire night. \r<br /><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LY-TELR9nIw/Tj906rXrmOI/AAAAAAAAJNE/w3CsjgZR-38/s1600/rib%2Beye.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-LY-TELR9nIw/Tj906rXrmOI/AAAAAAAAJNE/w3CsjgZR-38/s1600/rib%2Beye.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5638353809914435810\" /></a>For my entree, I had the grilled rib eye with dungeness crab butter, roasted truffle potatoes, sauteed asparagus, and a red wine demi glace. It was amazing.</div><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vlnVcLS3I3c/Tj906U3UHvI/AAAAAAAAJM8/MqTPn3QFWCk/s1600/veal.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vlnVcLS3I3c/Tj906U3UHvI/AAAAAAAAJM8/MqTPn3QFWCk/s1600/veal.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5638353803873099506\" /></a>Alan had the pan roasted veal rib chop with creamy polenta, french beans, and a cluster of wild mushrooms. His polenta was out of this world! Lucky for me, Alan's not the hugest polenta fan, so I got to dig right in. </div><div>\r<br /></div><div>Even though I was plenty full by the end of the meal, we had to try Nick's much talked about banana bread pudding. It came on a beautiful plate covered in swirly sauces (don't swirly sauces make everything taste so much better?) and was the perfect end to the night. </div><div>\r<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UEYIMCVOPZM/Tj906AUgquI/AAAAAAAAJM0/iKJG88AvyVI/s1600/inside.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UEYIMCVOPZM/Tj906AUgquI/AAAAAAAAJM0/iKJG88AvyVI/s1600/inside.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5638353798358412002\" /></a>\r<br /></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8672346553387039720/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
