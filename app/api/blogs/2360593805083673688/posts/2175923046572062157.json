This year, I'm determined to enjoy every moment of it which began with decorating my apartment. The long Thanksgiving weekend was the perfect time to make it merry and bright. I enlisted my cousins to help me fold my old issues of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Real Simple </span>to make the above magazine Christmas trees. They are so easy to make (even soothingly so) since all you need to do is fold, snip off the bottoms with a pair of scissors, spray paint and sprinkle with some glitter. (You can learn how to make them <a href=\"http://bit.ly/eNaQnD\">here</a> or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/i1D5Ml\">here</a>).<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1g8mRGNI/AAAAAAAAEyM/bbAWR4Wk3dA/s1600/christmas%2Btrees%2Ball%2Baglow.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1g8mRGNI/AAAAAAAAEyM/bbAWR4Wk3dA/s1600/christmas%2Btrees%2Ball%2Baglow.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5545538093803706578\" border=\"0\" /></a>We bought a tiny tree for our tiny apartment, and my sister helped me decide on the white and champagne color theme. It makes me feel so warm and gooey inside to see it all lit up at night.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gldB67I/AAAAAAAAEyE/6hewgEMstKA/s1600/recycled%2Bholiday%2Bcard%2Bgarland.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 485px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gldB67I/AAAAAAAAEyE/6hewgEMstKA/s1600/recycled%2Bholiday%2Bcard%2Bgarland.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5545538087590947762\" border=\"0\" /></a>I can never stand to throw away old cards, but I never know what to do with them either. This year, I used a small bowl as a stencil and cut out circles to make a recycled holiday card garland.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gXAR7HI/AAAAAAAAEx8/QnHTSv3uH4M/s1600/method%2Bcinnamon%2Bbark.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gXAR7HI/AAAAAAAAEx8/QnHTSv3uH4M/s1600/method%2Bcinnamon%2Bbark.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5545538083712265330\" border=\"0\" /></a>Method hand soaps are my fave, so I was super excited to find out that they make special holiday scents. The Cinnamon Bark one smells like a mix of gingerbread men and happiness. <br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gKpwBjI/AAAAAAAAEx0/xyaFVlPitOU/s1600/holiday%2Bcards.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPW1gKpwBjI/AAAAAAAAEx0/xyaFVlPitOU/s1600/holiday%2Bcards.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5545538080396543538\" border=\"0\" /></a>Happy crafting! I hope your holiday season is off to a golden, glittery start :)<br /><br />p.s. I can't wait to bake more cookies and make a gingerbread house.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"11","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2175923046572062157/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
