The messy stacks of paper. The half empty coffee cups. And the absence of any pictures.&nbsp;\"Why don't you have any pictures?\" she pried. \"Well,\" I said, thinking it over. \"Well, because I'm... I'm a private person.\" She gave me a look like I was stranger than strange and walked away. After she left, I thought about how I'm not really that private if I go home every night to share the details of my life on the Internet, so I've since put up a few pictures of Alan and my family. Sometimes someone will come by and see the picture of my sister Sophie and ask if that's me. And I always think <i>Wouldn't that be the strangest thing to have a framed picture of myself sitting on my desk? </i>Which makes me wonder, is it not that strange? Do you have any solo pictures of yourself in your work space? What other pictures do you keep?<br />\n<br />\n(Image <a href=\"http://bit.ly/xu6V4n\" target=\"_blank\">via</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1446837594865420815/comments"},"labels":["office talk"]}
