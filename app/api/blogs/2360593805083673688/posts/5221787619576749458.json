When I got it, I was in the middle of a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/pOFSNU\">tea party</a> where everyone was drinking hot tea and sweating at the same time, but I was excited to have a cookbook dedicated to soups nonetheless. This chilly weekend, I finally put it to use and made a chicken soup with lime and cilantro. What made me excited about the book — the simplicity of the ingredients and recipes — was what also made me a little skeptical about it. I thought the soup might be a little boring, but it turned out fantastic. The lime brightens it up, and the chicken is nice and savory. My favorite part was the crunch of the corn. Next time, I might use a touch less lime (it was pretty zingy) but other than that, it was simple, quick, and delicious. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rz42IqA_Kgc/Trd80RRmmiI/AAAAAAAAJlA/Izm0FDyGYq4/s1600/soup+2+.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rz42IqA_Kgc/Trd80RRmmiI/AAAAAAAAJlA/Izm0FDyGYq4/s1600/soup+2+.jpg\" /></a><br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HhDgVAsSnl8/Trd81Zfj87I/AAAAAAAAJlI/ncrfUxkcGJ0/s1600/soup+3+.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HhDgVAsSnl8/Trd81Zfj87I/AAAAAAAAJlI/ncrfUxkcGJ0/s1600/soup+3+.jpg\" /></a></div><br />\n<b>Chicken Soup with Lime and Cilantro</b><br />\n<b>Slightly adapted from <i>For the Love of Soup</i></b><br />\n<i><br />\n</i><br />\n1 Tbsp olive oil<br />\n1 medium onion, chopped<br />\n4 garlic cloves, minced<br />\n2 tsp chili powder<br />\n3 boneless, skinless chicken breast pieces, diced<br />\n4 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br />\n2 ripe tomatoes, chopped<br />\n1 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels<br />\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice (I might try cutting this in half the next time I make this)<br />\nsmall bunch fresh cilantro sprigs, tied together with kitchen string<br />\nsalt and freshly ground pepper<br />\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro<br />\n<br />\n1.
