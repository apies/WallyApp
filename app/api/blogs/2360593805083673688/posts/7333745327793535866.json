To this day, I still love it. When I lived in L.A., my friends made fun of me for making it a point to visit the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/j8i4iY\">Santa Monica Public Library</a> on opening day, and Alan doesn't get why I don't just order all my books off of Amazon. But the library is comforting and quiet and modest and humble. It's like a good wise friend that you can sit and visit with uninterrupted for hours on end. My library of choice lately is the <a href=\"http://1.usa.gov/l8xVq3\">Central Park Library</a> in Santa Clara which looks new and modern, with plenty of seating and books galore. (It's also across the street from the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/kiWjPk\">best donuts in the world</a> which is maybe my favorite 2-for-1 deal ever). I currently have <i>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother </i>and <i>Bossypants </i>checked out, both of which I'd highly recommend if you like funny, entertaining reading.  <div><br /><div><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JsXBurfox1M/TdNnjtg0OSI/AAAAAAAAGqc/3G0rgNVd5Cg/s1600/books.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 414px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JsXBurfox1M/TdNnjtg0OSI/AAAAAAAAGqc/3G0rgNVd5Cg/s1600/books.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5607939824216717602\" /></a><div style=\"text-align: center;\">{Currently snacking on these Haribo gummy bears a friend brought back from Germany.
