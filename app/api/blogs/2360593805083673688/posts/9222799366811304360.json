Before Alan, I’d always been much better at identifying the exact moment when I knew the person I was dating was definitely <i>not</i> the one. My senior year of college, in a very cliché moment of life, I started seeing a guy named Sam. He didn’t go to my school, but he was in a band and had cool band-guy hair. Those two things alone were his most memorable attributes, and I let it slide that we had almost nothing in common. After all, his hair – the cool hair – and my appreciation for it, seemed, at the time, like the building blocks of a solid relationship.<br />\n<br />\nAfter a few dates, however, I began to wonder if we’d be able to make it work. Our evenings of eating pizza together were oddly quiet, but he was a nice guy, and in a college world full of frat guys, you could do a lot worse than eat pizza with a nice guy in a band.<br />\n<br />\nHalloween rolled around, and in a moment of costume brainstorming, I had a brilliant idea. “I know,” I said feverishly, my excitement growing by the second. “I’ll wrap myself in aluminum foil, stick Al on my back… and be an element!” I beamed at him. When he kept looking at me blankly, I went on, “You know, like on the periodic table.”<br />\n<br />\nFinally, in the most telling moment of our humdrum relationship, he said, “What’s the periodic table?” And in that moment I knew we would never work. He pushed a lock of hair off his face, and I watched it spring perfectly back into place.<br />\n<br />\nWe stopped seeing each other soon after, but I always thought it'd be funny if we had made it to Halloween if he matched my costume by covering himself in salt and being the element sodium.<br />\n<br />\nHave you guys had moments in your relationships where you definitely knew it was going to work or not? What happened?<br />\n<br />\n(Top image source via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ndqPTh\">All Women Stalk</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/9222799366811304360/comments"},"labels":["My (Mildly) Roaring 20s"]}
