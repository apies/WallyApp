Since I love trying new restaurants for both kinds of food, I thought I'd start sharing some of my food adventures here. <div><br /></div><div>Recently I had dinner at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fW7IuO\">DishDash</a> and ordered, against all my prior prejudices of mixing sweet and salty, the Beriani Dejaj. The description read like a celebration of textures: Thinly sliced, marinated breast of chicken, potatoes, golden raisins, garbanzo beans with a mixture of spices, topped with aged yogurt sauce and served with rice. Everything sounded so lovely, but I worried the raisins might ruin it. I decided to give it a go and was pleasantly surprised, especially by the richness of the yogurt sauce and the subtle punctuation of sweetness from the raisins. This is officially my new dinner-time obsession. </div><div><br /></div><div>The cookie is a TKO (Thomas Keller Oreo) from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ggh7n6\">Bouchon</a> up in Yountville, and it is a ridiculously perfect cookie. I definitely need to get my hands on a recipe ASAP.</div><div><br /></div><div> </div><div>If you're in the Bay, I'd love to know if you've ever tried any of these places or have any similar restaurants you'd recommend! </div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8907559875204142355/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
