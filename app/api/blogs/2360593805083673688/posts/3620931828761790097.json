They're just meant to be check-ups, but the fear that the oncologist might find a lump or something somewhere always freaks him out. This time, though, it was all good news. She reminded us that it's been three years since his cancer diagnosis which is <i>great</i>! Hitting the three-year milestone means the chance of recurrence drastically drops. I almost cried. I always knew that the five-year mark was a big deal, but not about three, so it was a sweet surprise. She thinks we should celebrate, which I wholeheartedly agree with, so this weekend I'll be researching destinations for a long weekend trip (or maybe even Hawaii!) Have a wonderful weekend, my friends, and be sure to take some time to share some love. Haha, cheesy, but true!<br />\n<br />","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3620931828761790097/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
