I love bundling up and getting cozy, but this winter feels like it's gone on forever. I can't wait to leave my jacket behind, and I'm still not over the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/euf5jm\">slouchy trouser pants</a> I wrote about in the fall. With some high-heeled sandals, these pants look like they're going to be my springtime staple. Here's a roundup of my favorite ones:<div><br /></div><div>Likes: Forever 21 <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gFQKHy\">Career Day Trousers</a>, $24.80 - for less than $25, these slouchy (yet slim!) pants won't break the bank and will perk up an all-black-trouser work week.<br /><div><div><br /></div><div>Wants: Urban Outfitters <a href=\"http://bit.ly/f5b7Ss\">Furies Obi Pant</a>, $120 - finished with a wide waistband and a tiny button at the cuff of each leg, I'm sold.</div><div><br /></div><div>Desires: Phillip Lim <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gZ1OBZ\">draped tapered trousers</a>, $375 - last year I was at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/h6axvT\">Tartine eating a croissant</a>, half a loaf of fresh hot bread, and a banana cream tart, and the only thing that could have possibly distracted me in that moment was the sight of a girl wearing these pants. They looked seriously amazing.</div></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8926715827764860892/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
