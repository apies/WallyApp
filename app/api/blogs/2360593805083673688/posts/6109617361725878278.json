On Saturday, Alan and I spent the entire afternoon walking all around our neighborhood--we got iced coffee, ogled the fancy cheeses and salami at Zanotto's, and I picked up <a href=\"http://gap.us/lejkVb\">these shoes</a> at Gap. Today, I wore a summery skirt and walked around the Campbell farmer's market with a friend. The weather was amazing, and it seemed like a simple cobbler would be the perfect way to end the weekend. I recently picked up <a href=\"http://amzn.to/ix9AVO\">Ad Hoc at Home</a> from the library, and decided to follow TK's blueberry cobbler recipe. <div><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zQsciGYgHh0/Tb49-3Z_jbI/AAAAAAAAGmY/uXpQkdVNOR0/s1600/blueberries.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zQsciGYgHh0/Tb49-3Z_jbI/AAAAAAAAGmY/uXpQkdVNOR0/s1600/blueberries.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5601983136729632178\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bg6NmxLgDgU/Tb49-glS22I/AAAAAAAAGmQ/aJpEQ5r89jQ/s1600/before%2Bbaking.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bg6NmxLgDgU/Tb49-glS22I/AAAAAAAAGmQ/aJpEQ5r89jQ/s1600/before%2Bbaking.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5601983130603019106\" /></a><br /><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fNi1zRnD5aA/Tb49-Wa7JtI/AAAAAAAAGmI/zupH3VfiHmc/s1600/baked%2521.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fNi1zRnD5aA/Tb49-Wa7JtI/AAAAAAAAGmI/zupH3VfiHmc/s1600/baked%2521.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5601983127875167954\" /></a>Most cobblers I've had have either a granola or crumble topping, but this version has a beautiful cake-like topping (that, judging by appearances alone, one might be tempted to think taste like dry biscuits, but don't be fooled!) They soak up the blueberry juices perfectly. Add a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top, and this cobbler, fresh out of the oven, is just divine. I can't wait until peaches are in season to make this again!   </div><div><br /></div><div>Blueberry Cobbler</div><div>Adapted from <i>Ad Hoc at Home </i>by Thomas Keller</div><div><br /></div><div>Topping</div><div>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</div><div>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</div><div>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</div><div>6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, at room temperature</div><div>3/4 cup granulated sugar</div><div>2 large eggs</div><div>1/2 cup buttermilk</div><div><br /></div><div>Filling</div><div>4 pints (8 cups) blueberries</div><div>1/4 cup granulated sugar</div><div>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</div><div>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</div><div><br /></div><div>Cinnamon Sugar</div><div>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</div><div>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or to taste</div><div><br /></div><div>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sift together the flour, baking powder, and baking soda; set aside.</div><div><br /></div><div>Put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle (I just used a hand mixer and it worked fine) and mix on low speed to combine, then beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes, until the mixture is light and creamy, scraping down the sides as necessary. Beat in the eggs one at a time until fully incorporated. Add the dry ingredients in 3 batches, alternating with the buttermilk in 2 batches. Scrape down the sides and mix again to be certain that all the ingredients are combined. </div><div><br />Put the blueberries in a large bowl and toss with the sugar, flour, and zest.
