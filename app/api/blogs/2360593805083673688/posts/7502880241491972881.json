At first, I wanted to put up sconces but couldn't find any affordable options that I really liked (although <a href=\"http://anthrpl.ge/Qcsyop\" target=\"_blank\">Anthropologie</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/QcsULL\" target=\"_blank\">Restoration Hardware</a> had some amazing ones). I found this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/W42cGK\" target=\"_blank\">vintage-meets-modern gold lamp</a> from The Land of Nod and love how chic it makes the room look. It also attaches with a clip so it's easy to move around and adjust. Do you read in bed at night? It has to be one of my favorite ways to end the day.&nbsp;</div>\n","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7502880241491972881/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
