I was also shocked today to see a Facebook picture of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/9jV8Fw\">Petrie</a> playing in actual <i>snow</i> in my parents' backyard in Oregon. These are places that, I know, get really, really cold. And still, somehow, whenever the temperature dips to 50 or below here in California, I can barely stand it. This past Saturday was one of those days, so I stayed in and mixed up a thick, sticky batter for a large batch of crumpets. I had found the recipe in the paper the day before, and it seemed like just the thing to smother in butter and jam and pair with a mug of hot coffee. <div>     <br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--5p4X5RmJtM/TWySajfxDuI/AAAAAAAAGXA/-l54CMramow/s1600/DSC_1301.JPG\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--5p4X5RmJtM/TWySajfxDuI/AAAAAAAAGXA/-l54CMramow/s1600/DSC_1301.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578995023307935458\" /></a><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KdpXYQ0MeG0/TWySaWo03xI/AAAAAAAAGW4/LTfT1olzPtM/s1600/DSC_1303.JPG\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KdpXYQ0MeG0/TWySaWo03xI/AAAAAAAAGW4/LTfT1olzPtM/s1600/DSC_1303.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578995019856273170\" /></a>Note: the whole crumpet-making process can be sped up through the use of more than one biscuit ring on the griddle. However, it can be fun to make them the torturously slow way, one at a time, and to eat them standing up in the kitchen as they come off the griddle so that they are all gone before the last one is even finished cooking.</div><div><br /></div><div><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lCpPnaDTtLo/TWySaLfGBeI/AAAAAAAAGWw/mbVQAN2scpY/s1600/DSC_1316.JPG\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lCpPnaDTtLo/TWySaLfGBeI/AAAAAAAAGWw/mbVQAN2scpY/s1600/DSC_1316.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578995016862664162\" /></a>The mock clotted cream the recipe suggested sounded good, but not as good as simple salted butter and blueberry jam (my favorite).</div><div><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tnxaSeY7Dnw/TWySZ1rGzJI/AAAAAAAAGWo/f9ab2MEBCO8/s1600/DSC_1306.JPG\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tnxaSeY7Dnw/TWySZ1rGzJI/AAAAAAAAGWo/f9ab2MEBCO8/s1600/DSC_1306.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578995011007466642\" /></a><br /></div><div><b>Crumpets with Mock Clotted Cream</b></div><div>As adapted from Melissa Clark's recipe from the <i>New York Times</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>Serves 6-8</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div>1 cup warm milk</div><div>2 1/4 teaspoons yeast</div><div>1 teaspoon honey or sugar</div><div>1 1/2 cups warm water</div><div>3 cups all-purpose flour</div><div>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</div><div>1 teaspoon baking powder</div><div>1 cup mascarpone</div><div>6 tablespoons heavy cream</div><div>olive oil for cooking</div><div><br /></div><div>1.

For flat, pancake-like crumpets, spoon batter onto the griddle and cook 3-4 minutes on one side and 1-2 minutes on the other. Or, use well-oiled English-muffin rings or cookie cutters. Place on the skillet. Spoon in batter  1/4-inch high. Let cook until dry around the edges and bubbles have formed over the surface, 5-6 minutes. Remove rings and wipe clean. Flip crumpets; cook until lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. Re-oil the griddle and rings before making another batch. Serve with butter and jam or mock clotted cream.</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4393221316848875001/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
