First we toured USF, then we <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ytiRT8\" target=\"_blank\">lunched</a> in Hayes Valley, followed by a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/zbjVHd\" target=\"_blank\">little</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/sephora-san-francisco-3\" target=\"_blank\">shopping</a>,&nbsp;before we walked back through SOMA to meet up with Alan. All that walking around put us in the mood for a treat, and since we were in the neighborhood, I knew just where to go. Sophie's never had macarons before, so it was fun taking her to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ySMFjW\" target=\"_blank\">Chantal Guillon</a>, one of the cutest macaron shops I've ever been to. Her favorite flavors were the pistachio and espresso, mine were the red velvet and passionfruit. But really, they were all so good we could have sat there and eaten a few dozen more easy-peasy.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7645264437868671908/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
