I'm still trying to find my groove at work, and the rest of the week is going to be filled with a walking date with my friend <a href=\"http://bit.ly/qLvIkk\">Stacy</a>, a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/himOdG\">Content Magazine</a> interview with a pizza shop owner at the up and coming <a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrD2jI\">San Pedro Square Market</a>, and planning for my birthday party. It sort of feels weird to be turning 28, but then normal at the same time. I remember when I was in high school I used to think being 20 was <i>old. </i>I thought by then that I'd be married with a house and two kids and have everything all figured out. Ha! At least I'm still getting carded for rated R movies.* ;)<div>\r<br /></div><div>I'm celebrating my birthday in two parts because, as Alan would tell you, I like to stretch out the celebration for as long as possible. This weekend, we're going to Shaver Lake with friends for my actual birthday, and then the weekend after I'm planning a little party. The most time consuming part is the creation of an overhead installation (I like how the word 'installation' makes it sound serious and significant when it's really kinda fun and easy to make) involving many, many paper circles, glue, and string. It's going to look amazing once it's all done. </div><div>\r<br /></div><div>I hope your week has been off to a good, productive start. Happy Wednesday, friends!\r<br /><div>\r<br /></div><div><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" >*This weekend Alan and I went to see <i><a href=\"http://imdb.to/r4SAO6\">Fright Night</a> </i>with the adorable <a href=\"http://imdb.to/pvZJFG\">Anton Yelchin</a> when the cashier asked to check my ID since it was a rated R movie. Does that make me old to be happy that I got carded? Somehow I think it does...</span></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7547904289102346134/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
