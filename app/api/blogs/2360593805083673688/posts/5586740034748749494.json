I'd heard really great things about them (even my sister who is a bona fide beauty expert says they're awesome) so I decided to try them out. They were super easy to apply--just peel the backing off to reveal the adhesive side, press the strips on your nails, and then file away the excess. My cousin <a href=\"http://bit.ly/lXHfvn\">Nat</a> put some on 10 minutes before a party, and since you don't have to wait for them to dry (my favorite part) they were perfect! They are definitely eye-catching and they come in lots of different prints and neon shades. Would you try them?</div><div><br /></div><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3R_5a8VAdiQ/Th-_Zq20b9I/AAAAAAAAI_s/knvkhqWAffQ/s1600/DSC_0049%2Bcopy.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3R_5a8VAdiQ/Th-_Zq20b9I/AAAAAAAAI_s/knvkhqWAffQ/s1600/DSC_0049%2Bcopy.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5629428506958262226\" /></a><br /><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5586740034748749494/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
