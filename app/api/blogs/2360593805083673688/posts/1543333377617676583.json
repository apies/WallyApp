The problem? They're so expensive! So, earlier this year, I bought myself the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VJ6TO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0006VJ6TO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quilikhor-20\">Body Back Buddy</a><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quilikhor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0006VJ6TO\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" width=\"1\" />. I was skeptical at first (how good could a piece of plastic really be?), but as it turns out, amazing! I automatically reach for it as soon as I get home. It makes it really easy to control the amount of pressure you want and gets my knots out.<br />\n<br />\nIf you have company over, just beware that some of the knobs may look a bit... suspect, haha. I used my Back Buddy once while my friend <a href=\"http://bit.ly/qLvIkk\" target=\"_blank\">Stacy</a> was in the middle of telling me a story, and she couldn't take me seriously/stop laughing. But then, another friend told me a lady at her work even uses her Back Buddy in meetings. They're so awesome. If you rate shoulder rubs up there next to pizza and puppies, I'd highly recommend it! And for under $35, it's very affordable.<br />\n<br />\nHave you used one? Would you give it a try?","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1543333377617676583/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
