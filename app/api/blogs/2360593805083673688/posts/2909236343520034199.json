I plan on reading a giant stack of magazines on the long plane ride, eating lots of the free peanuts (or maybe they will have better goodies than that?), reading non-serious books on the beach, not getting eaten by mosquitoes, and taking lots of pictures of the place where my parents grew up.<br /><br />Our first stop is Hong Kong where we'll be visiting Hong Kong Disney and our friend Matt. Almost as excited as I am to see him thousands of miles away from home, I am almost equally as excited to eat cute Asian Disneyland foods, like these Chicken Little dumplings! <br /><br />(photo via <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7411850@N04/5245425274/\">flickr</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2909236343520034199/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
