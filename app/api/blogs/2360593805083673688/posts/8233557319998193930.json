For a long while I had my eye on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/lurKNR\">these shoes</a>, but they were way out of my price range. Then when I found <a href=\"http://bit.ly/lYSgb8\">these</a> at a fraction of the price, I rushed into the store to try them on and was disappointed when my foot spilled out from all sides. I had almost started stocking up on flip flops, when I randomly decided to stop by the comfort shoe store (super sexy, I know) and try on these <a href=\"http://bit.ly/joEd72\">Indigo by Clarks shoes</a> (seen <a href=\"http://bit.ly/jpgsUH\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/merZ9r\">here</a>). It was love. These shoes and I are seriously meant to be. They're wide, go with everything, and have extra comfy padded soles. The best is how I can wear them to the office all day and then walk around after work without having to change shoes right away. Brilliant! This is my second pair of Indigo by Clarks (my first pair seen <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fhfIRu\">here</a>), and they just keep getting better. I can't wait to see what sassy comfort shoes they have in store for me and my wide-footed friends this fall.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8233557319998193930/comments"},"labels":["To Wear"]}
