I'm a huge pastry fanatic, and so I knew one of the first things I had to find on my trip to Boston last week was a good pastry shop. Luckily, I was staying just up the street from Flour, a mouth-watering bakery and cafe owned by Joanne Chang. She threw down with Bobby Flay to see who could make the best sticky buns--and she won! I had to try one of her buns for myself and walked the mile from my hotel the very next morning. It reminded me of Tartine in the sense that I wanted to devour everything in sight, and in my lust, I almost forgot what I had come for. But then, I remembered. I took my sticky bun and coffee, sat down at a corner table, and ate the entire thing. It was sticky and sweet and topped with nuts, and I barely had room for lunch later that day.
