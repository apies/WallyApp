At parties, these are the first questions I'll ask: What do you do? How did you get there? What do you eat for lunch? Since I always wonder how people spend their days, I'm starting a new series called \"In the Office\" which will highlight women who enjoy what they do. The focus will be on women with \"regular\" office jobs because I feel like we always read about those with non-traditional careers, but I feel like office jobs can be just as interesting, challenging, and rewarding. I hope you enjoy it!<br />\n<br />\nComing right up is my friend Sarah Garcia, a usability experience researcher, who is always working with the coolest clients and going on rad business trips.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\">\n<a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1imbbpIidYg/UD99UpztkaI/AAAAAAAAPCQ/NK0ZRgTJaXc/s1600/steve+martin+quote.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1imbbpIidYg/UD99UpztkaI/AAAAAAAAPCQ/NK0ZRgTJaXc/s1600/steve+martin+quote.jpeg\" /></a></div>\n<br />\n(top image by Bonnie Tsang via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RgudGI\" target=\"_blank\">The Glitter Guide</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7382043739448652284/comments"},"labels":["In the Office","To See"]}
