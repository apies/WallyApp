Roy had the brilliant idea to make his favorite lasagna al forno (a recipe by Gordon Ramsay) and it was hands down the best lasagna I've ever had in my life. I'm not even embarrassed to admit (okay, maybe just a little) that I went to bed with a stomach ache because I couldn't stop eating! It's a delicious, sophisticated take on the traditional version, substituting a creamy bechamel sauce for the ricotta and requiring extra attention to the meat sauce--there was even wine added! <div>\r<br />You can find Gordon Ramsay's recipe <a href=\"http://bit.ly/nohL14\">right here</a>, but you may want to tweak it to your liking. (Roy adds more wine, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, and garlic.)</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/1768061677463612467/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
