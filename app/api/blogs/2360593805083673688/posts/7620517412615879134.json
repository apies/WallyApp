Ordering take out and curling up in our living room is one of our favorite things to do. Ever since we set up our own cozy home theater, we watch a lot of movies on Netflix Watch Instantly or through Amazon Instant Video. I thought it'd be fun to start sharing some of the movies I really enjoy here in case you, too, love dimming the lights and getting wrapped up in a flickering story after a long week. (Note: since we hardly watch movies in&nbsp;theaters&nbsp;anymore, most of my movie recommendations will be movies already out on DVD. Just thought I'd mention that in case you are a huge theater-goer and have already seen all these!).&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3-tV4ksoO0I/T2LEXeGx8LI/AAAAAAAANA4/-K0Gs8L8xEo/s1600/take+shelter.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3-tV4ksoO0I/T2LEXeGx8LI/AAAAAAAANA4/-K0Gs8L8xEo/s640/take+shelter.jpg\" width=\"433\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><i>Take Shelter</i> is about a young dad and husband who lives a simple life in a small town. He starts having apocalyptic visions of a massively destructive storm and becomes obsessed with building a shelter for him and his family. It's a quiet movie that's a tad slow, but it's beautifully shot, well-acted, and the building tension and uncertainty of what his visions mean make it thoroughly eerie and haunting. &nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-POqPXTcbz20/T2LLKgWg2lI/AAAAAAAANBA/8232HDN-S3Q/s1600/the+skin+i+live+in.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-POqPXTcbz20/T2LLKgWg2lI/AAAAAAAANBA/8232HDN-S3Q/s640/the+skin+i+live+in.jpg\" width=\"432\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><i>The Skin I Live In</i>&nbsp;is dark and twisted, but also quirky in its own way. It's about a plastic surgeon who has obsessed for years over creating the perfect artificial skin that could have saved his wife who had been horribly burned years ago. When he finally creates the perfect skin, he finds a surprising candidate to test it out on. Full of shocking twists, this movie's story was quick and clever. It also doesn't hurt that the two main characters, Antonia Banderas and Elena Anaya, are both gorgeous.</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DgOP8HPKjTc/T2LQUjIKlXI/AAAAAAAANBI/X4FD0DSZ6rk/s1600/tucker+and+dale+vs+evil.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"640\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DgOP8HPKjTc/T2LQUjIKlXI/AAAAAAAANBI/X4FD0DSZ6rk/s640/tucker+and+dale+vs+evil.jpg\" width=\"433\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">One movie genre I don't watch much of is comedy. Not that I don't like to laugh but finding a good comedy to watch is hard for me. So I was really surprised when my cousin Nathalie recommended I watch <i>Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil </i>&nbsp;and found that I laughed out loud the entire movie. The two main characters — Tucker and Dale — are the most adorable hillbillies who find themselves in these absurd, hilarious predicaments when all they're trying to do is relax in their remote vacation cabin. (<i>Available on Netflix Watch Instantly).</i></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><b>Have you seen, or would you watch, any of these?
