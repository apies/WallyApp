In fact, I didn't even know what they were a couple of years ago. I had <i>seen</i> them, but their neon colors didn't seem quite that appetizing. It wasn't until last year that I tried my first one at Cocola because my friend Sashee had just come back from Paris raving about Laduree's macarons (of course, she said Laduree's were better). <div><br /></div><div>Recently, a macaron craving has hit me like a ton of bricks, and it makes me remember what it feels like to have a grade-school crush. These delicate cookies make me feel giddy inside, and I just want to chase them all around the playground while simultaneously denying any interest in them. Because while they're perfectly sweet with a wonderfully crispy, chewy texture, they're not the cheapest cookies on the block. <i>But they're so good! </i>One day soon, I'll have to try Laduree's famous macarons, but until then, I'm slowly trying all the macarons the Bay Area has to offer. Pamplemousse in Redwood City makes a mighty mean salted caramel. My other favorites were the pistachio and the cassis (black currant). The strawberry tasted a little bit too artificial for my liking, but it was still pretty tasty. My least favorite was probably the Mayan chocolate. With its spicy kick, it reminded me a little bit too much of a Hot Tamales. Overall though, I'd never say no to a Pamplemousse macaron! <div>  <br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w9leK4H2of4/TXR-wO3z1WI/AAAAAAAAGX8/P0ggM9SpEC8/s1600/pamplemousse%2Bmacarons.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-w9leK4H2of4/TXR-wO3z1WI/AAAAAAAAGX8/P0ggM9SpEC8/s1600/pamplemousse%2Bmacarons.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5581225205309887842\" /></a><br /></div></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"10","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5207179237598874142/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
