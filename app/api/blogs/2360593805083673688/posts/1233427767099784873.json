But since I've been blogging and wanting to get more serious about writing my short stories, I've definitely reconsidered. There's something comforting about having a designated place to sit and do work I love, and so lately I've been obsessed with creating a home office space that's uncluttered, inspiring, and fun (perhaps the complete opposite of my office desk). Whereas I'm normally drawn to rustic vintage decor, I'm loving the idea of a sleek modern workspace. Regardless of style, I think every home office needs a great roomy desk, a chair, a lamp, a place to stash papers and notebooks, and a pretty little something just because.
