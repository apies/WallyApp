It's my first guest post ever, and I was beyond flattered when <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ic8cCQ\">Krista</a> asked me if I would be interested in writing one. I immediately fell in love with her blog when I saw these amazing <a href=\"http://bit.ly/h40WLt\">business cards</a> she made and when I realized she loves <a href=\"http://bit.ly/gSvAsN\">Christmas</a> as much as I do. Her blog is one of my favorite reads.
