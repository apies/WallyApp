Since the weather isn't exactly putting me in a cozy, sweater-wearing mood, I decided some baking might do the trick. And what better ingredient to induce autumn comfort than pumpkin?<br />\n<br />\nThis pumpkin spice cake was really moist, light, and not too sweet. I wasn't in the mood for frosting, so I opted instead for a cream cheese swirl top which was really good. The next time I make this, though, I think I will make a cream cheese frosting because the cake's texture is so nice and fluffy. This also made our whole apartment smell wonderful, which is reason enough for me to bake this again :)<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<b>Spiced Pumpkin Swirl Cake</b><br />\nAs adapted from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/RDWQ1S\" target=\"_blank\">Not So Humble Pie</a>&nbsp;(original recipe by <i><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906868239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906868239&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quilikhor-20\">Bake!: Essential Techniques for Perfect Baking</a><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=quilikhor-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1906868239\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" width=\"1\" />) </i>and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/SZoEhe\" target=\"_blank\">The Food Network</a><br />\n<i><br /></i>\nyields 2 8\" or 9\" cake rounds<br />\n<br />\n3 cups all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)<br />\n1 cup granulated sugar<br />\n2 teaspoons baking powder<br />\n2 teaspoons baking soda<br />\n3/4 teaspoon salt<br />\n1 tablespoon ground cinnamon<br />\n2 teaspoons ground ginger<br />\n2 teaspoons freshly ground nutmeg (I didn't use freshly ground nutmeg, although I'm sure this cake would taste that much better with it)<br />\n1 cup golden brown sugar, firmly packed<br />\n2 cups canned pumpkin puree (I used one 15 oz can)<br />\n5 large eggs, at room temperature<br />\n1 1/4 cup vegetable oil<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nCream cheese swirl:<br />\n8 ounces cream cheese, softened<br />\n1/4 cup sugar<br />\n1 egg<br />\n1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPreheat your oven to 350Â°F and prepare two 8\" or 9\" round cake pans with a light coating of non-stick spray and then line the bottoms with parchment.<br />\n<br />\nIn a large bowl, sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices. Once sifted, give it a good mixing with a whisk to ensure everything is evenly distributed and then set aside.<br />\n<br />\nIn a second large bowl, add the brown sugar and a third of the pumpkin puree. Combine the two with a spatula, pressing firmly to ensure there are no rogue lumps of sugar. &nbsp;Once lump free, add the remaining pumpkin and oil. Blend with a whisk and then add the eggs, one at a time, stirring with the whisk to incorporate after each addition.<br />\n<br />\nAdd the dry ingredients a third at a time, blending after each addition.<br />\n<br />\nDivide the batter between your two pans, reserving 1/2 cup of batter.<br />\n<br />\nFor the cream cheese swirl, blend together the cream cheese, sugar, egg, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Gently spread the cream cheese layer on top of the cake batter in the pans. Dollop the remaining cake batter over the cream cheese layer. Using a skewer or the tip of a knife, drag the tip through the cream cheese mixture to create a swirl pattern.<br />\n<br />\nPlace pans into the oven on a lower-middle rack. &nbsp;Bake for 40-45 minutes until risen and firm to the touch.<br />\n<br />\nLet the cakes stand in the pans on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes. Then unmold onto the racks and turn right-side up to cool completely.<br />\n<br />","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2297693993269046772/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
