It can be pretty overwhelming sifting through one man's junk to find another woman's treasure, but I find the whole process exhilarating, especially when I come across something really rad. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, but after my recent trip to the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/hNDKO7\">Antique Trove in Roseville</a>, I've found there are some things you can do to ensure a smooth antiquing adventure. (And check out some of the awesome store displays below!) <div><br /></div><div><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LY3GTsBcuY4/TYBPCBN3KRI/AAAAAAAAGaU/c-Fe37H491Q/s1600/display%2B1.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LY3GTsBcuY4/TYBPCBN3KRI/AAAAAAAAGaU/c-Fe37H491Q/s1600/display%2B1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584550434044324114\" /></a><div style=\"text-align: center;\">.<i>pretty anthropologie-esque table display</i></div></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><br /></i></div><div>Tip #2: Ask a patient friend to join you, preferably someone who's also into vintage finds (it's much more fun than going with someone who could care less about the silver pitcher you just spotted that would be perfect for your coffee table)</div><div><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0DUYvbwXAVY/TYBPB6y84WI/AAAAAAAAGaM/JhGZl1wUQOc/s1600/mushrooms%2Bin%2Ba%2Bwire%2Bbasket.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px; text-align: center; \" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0DUYvbwXAVY/TYBPB6y84WI/AAAAAAAAGaM/JhGZl1wUQOc/s1600/mushrooms%2Bin%2Ba%2Bwire%2Bbasket.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584550432320840034\" /></a><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>.mossy</i> <i>mushrooms in a wire basket</i></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Tip #3: Expand your search to places you might not usually think to look. For example, while Alan and I were in Roseville for a friend's baby shower, I decided to check out the antiques scene while we were there and was glad I did--seriously, the Antique Trove, awesome!-- even though going thrifting in Roseville had never once crossed my mind.</div><div><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0lTq6tvwdLw/TYBPBn0sm9I/AAAAAAAAGaE/AaK9DKT5_Mg/s1600/cool%2Bgarage.jpg\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px; text-align: center; \" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0lTq6tvwdLw/TYBPBn0sm9I/AAAAAAAAGaE/AaK9DKT5_Mg/s1600/cool%2Bgarage.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584550427227888594\" /></a><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>.cool garage/cabin display</i></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Tip #4: Do your research. When my friend Stacy asked me to go with her to a rummage sale, I did a quick search online to learn more about what items were for sale, where to park, and what the acceptable forms of payment were. The sale was an absolute mad house, but knowing what I was definitely not interested in seeing from the beginning helped narrow down my search of what I did want to check out.</div><div><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uefCrzgMqtw/TYBPBe3i1nI/AAAAAAAAGZ8/9H_QaDiVfvI/s1600/bee%2Bon%2Btime%2Bnecklace.jpg\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-uefCrzgMqtw/TYBPBe3i1nI/AAAAAAAAGZ8/9H_QaDiVfvI/s1600/bee%2Bon%2Btime%2Bnecklace.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5584550424823912050\" /></a><div style=\"text-align: center;\">.<i>some of the pretty jewelry I  had to keep myself away from. Although I don't think it's real vintage, this \"Bee On Time\" necklace is too cute!</i></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><br /></i></div>Tip #5: Have a general idea of the things you're looking to score. Sometimes it's fun to just walk around and look casually, but if you know what you're looking for, write it down. I don't know about you, but once I'm surrounded by cool vintage wares, I lose all memory of anything and everything I'd been hoping to find.
