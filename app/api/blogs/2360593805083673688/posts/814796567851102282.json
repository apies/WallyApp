I'm a huge fan, so I was super excited to see him live. He was performing at The Fillmore in San Francisco, and we snagged awesome seats. I laughed—and even laughed so hard I cried—throughout the entire show; the way he talks when he's telling a story absolutely kills me. When I found out he released the Dangerously Delicious special on his website, I went straight home after work and watched it again. I almost choked on my dinner a few times, so I can attest it's just as funny the second time. I watched it streaming, but now I'm downloading it so I can play back my favorite parts whenever I need a good laugh during the week. It's available to stream and/or download from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HiFuUe\" target=\"_blank\">www.azizansari.com</a><span id=\"goog_970829086\"></span><span id=\"goog_970829087\"></span><a href=\"http://www.blogger.com/\"></a> for just $5. I'd highly recommend it for some good weekend fun. Have you seen it?<br />\n<br />\n<i>{images via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HAq7At\" target=\"_blank\">theguardian</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IbGbN9\" target=\"_blank\">Aziz is Bored</a>}</i>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/814796567851102282/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
