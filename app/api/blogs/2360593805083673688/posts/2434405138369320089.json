When I sat down at my desk yesterday morning, I was greeted by the sweetest present: these soft, cinnamon-y pumpkin cookies. They were from my new friend at work whom I've already decided to ask to be my best friend, so long as we can eat seasonal cookies together every three months.

She shared the recipe with me, and I can't wait to make more.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TJrwyW516zI/AAAAAAAAEXE/ZlB8OxvLq4g/s1600/top+pumpkins.JPG\"><img style=\"margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 415px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TJrwyW516zI/AAAAAAAAEXE/ZlB8OxvLq4g/s1600/top+pumpkins.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5519989041228278578\" border=\"0\" /></a>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"3","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2434405138369320089/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
