They recently announced a new pricing structure which certainly riled a few feathers, but late Sunday their CEO Reed Hastings sent out an email to let everyone know they're splitting up their streaming and DVD by mail service entirely. Their DVD by mail service is getting completely re-branded and will now be known as Qwikster.com, while their streaming service will still go by Netflix. But the best part, and perhaps the most maddening of all, is that the sites won't be integrated. From the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/nDU6sB\">21,857 comments</a> posted on Reed's blog post (the one above made me laugh), no one else seems to get it either. Since I'm a total movie junkie, I just downgraded to streaming movies only, but I wonder how many people will be canceling their Netflix subscriptions altogether. Do you subscribe to Netflix? What do you think about this new change? &nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">p.s. a really <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ohlZLx\">funny comic</a> on this topic (thanks Sarah!)</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/3901329478550323624/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
