It was so cute and teeny and looked so convincingly to be made of plastic that I had to pick it up and smell it to make sure it was safe to eat--which, I'm sure, is the first thing most guests do upon arrival). But then I see rad places like this Wigwam Hotel that my co-worker stayed in while passing through Holbrook, Arizona, and I realize I'd probably have much more fun and feel much more comfortable (did you read the true story?) in a place like this. Each wigwam comes with a bath, heater, and A/C. I must sleep in a wigwam one of these days! <div><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-amveKrB-O08/Ta5Wvkfsl-I/AAAAAAAAGiE/dSGcxOlZZNY/s1600/wigwams.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 420px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-amveKrB-O08/Ta5Wvkfsl-I/AAAAAAAAGiE/dSGcxOlZZNY/s1600/wigwams.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5597506762118567906\" /></a>(photos by Dan Eberhardt)</div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"6","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/218569312796385820/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
