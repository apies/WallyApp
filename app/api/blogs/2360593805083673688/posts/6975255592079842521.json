First it started with some Peeps, but then I discovered the white chocolate M&amp;M's, and all of a sudden I had a cart full of Easter basket essentials. So I picked out some plastic eggs (side note: it seemed like there were a gazillion more plastic egg choices available than when I was a kid. Is this true? Or was I just a deprived child?), took them home, filled them all up with more sweets, and put together a few Easter goodie bags for friends. Surprising people with little gifts and handwritten notes is always a fun way to start the week :)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6975255592079842521/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
