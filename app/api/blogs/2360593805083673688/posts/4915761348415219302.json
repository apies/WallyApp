She laughed and said she's going to keep calling her mother-in-law by her first name. I call Alan's parents Mr. and Mrs. Pies, which sounds terribly formal when I say it out loud, but calling them by their first names also sounds weird to me. My cousin who's been married for over four years still calls her in-laws Mr. and Mrs., too!&nbsp;Do people call their in-laws Mom and Dad anymore? Do you/will you? If not, what will you call them? I'm so curious.<br />\n<br />\n(top photo by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/OrWw29\" target=\"_blank\">Brad Ross</a>, bottom photo via <a href=\"http://bit.ly/TpFibb\" target=\"_blank\">Birmingham Mail</a>)","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"8","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/4915761348415219302/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
