And don't you just love those people? I'm going to make it a goal to be more like that. Anyway, I hope you have a great weekendâ€”got any fun plans? I'm taking a friend out to dinner for his birthday, and we're going to pretend like it's not his birthday, per his request :).<span style=\"background-color: white;\">&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color: white;\"><br /></span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color: white;\">(Image by <a href=\"http://bit.ly/NtyCkc\" target=\"_blank\">Joielala</a>)</span>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/377282444098987750/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
