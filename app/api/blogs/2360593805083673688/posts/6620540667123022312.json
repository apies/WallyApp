On Saturday we stopped by the bizarre goodness that is the Mitsuwa grocery store/food court so we could try <a href=\"http://bit.ly/yB1nje\" target=\"_blank\">mochicream</a>. When I first heard about these Japanese rice cakes, their bright colors and promise of ice cream filling is what piqued my interest. Then I learned that they're not filled with ice cream at all, but a regular cream. I have to admit I was a teensy bit&nbsp;disappointed, but the variety of flavors — like chocolate banana, green tea, and blueberry yogurt — was still enough to get me through the door (being located next to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/zQxs81\" target=\"_blank\">this ramen spot</a> also helped). I had the black sesame and darjeeling tea, and Alan had the red bean and the green tea. Each mochicream is surrounded by soft mochi and filled with a light cream and smooth bean paste flavored accordingly. They were so good! I loved the flavors, especially the darjeeling, and the contrast between the light-as-air cream and chewy mochi.<br />\n<br />\nOn Sunday our streak of soft and squishy continued as we were walking into Costco and saw the cutest, most Vienna-sausage-shaped English bulldog ever. I wanted to steal him.<br />\n<br />\n{images by Quiet Like Horses}","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"1","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/6620540667123022312/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
