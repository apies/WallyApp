It even has fancy granite-top counters which is amazing for making things like bread, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/eagOKX\">soft pretzels</a>, or <a href=\"http://bit.ly/iwA6Ou\">pie crust</a>. The one down side to granite counters is they don't really provide the clean white background I like to have in my food photos. At first I tried using foam core as a backdrop — snooze. Then I tried white tablecloth — better. Still though, I wanted something that looked rustic and more kitchen-like. What I really wanted was an old whitewashed farm table, but even though our kitchen is <i>bigger,&nbsp;</i>it's definitely not huge.<br />\n<br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>I'd been thinking about a few different solutions, but they all involved building things with tools (which is not my forte) or winning the lottery. Then I went over to Ali and Elijah's house and realized Elijah is quite the carpenter — for fun, he made a baking cabinet for Ali to store all of her cake supplies in. So this weekend, my super handy and awesome neighbors helped me build the next best thing to a table: a tabletop made up of one 2x4! It fits right on my counter, stores easily, and makes for the perfect food photography backdrop. It took a just few hours to put together and to paint and cost $20 for all the materials. I haven't been this excited about taking food photos in a long time! It looks quite table-y, don't you think?","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/2384884420080004957/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
