While a (big)  part of me wishes the holiday season would go on forever, I have to  admit, I am excited for the new year. We found a real charmer of an  apartment which has kitchen counter space, closet space, and a  completely unnecessary (but darling nonetheless) fireplace that we'll be  moving into on the first!<br /><br />I've also been busy working on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/glqNMs\">Content Magazine</a>, a life and style  magazine with a focus on all things hip and stylish in San Jose. Beginning January 7, we'll be posting new content every  Friday, and while the emphasis will be on highlighting San Jose, I think there will be a lot that will  appeal to a much larger audience. I'm excited to be working with our  small core team, including the very talented <a href=\"http://bit.ly/fyWyGB\">Daniel Garcia</a> who has photographed people I have only ever seen on TV (like <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ehS1DZ\">Rebecca Romijn</a>). I got to hang out at a recent  shoot (which involved me holding props and saying things like \"ooh, I  like that\"-- you know, very important stuff) where the outfits were based on simple, shimmery, and lacy pieces. Since it was my first ever fashion  photo shoot-- with a real model, a hair and makeup stylist, a clothing  stylist, and all that jazz -- I snapped a few photos to share if you'd  like to see.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TQsJ3zNlcpI/AAAAAAAAE5M/kkuXYR48Tro/s1600/posing.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 600px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TQsJ3zNlcpI/AAAAAAAAE5M/kkuXYR48Tro/s1600/posing.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5551541819908911762\" border=\"0\" /></a>All done up!

It all paid off though because in the end, the pictures Daniel took were amazing.<br /><br />Please be sure to check out <a href=\"http://bit.ly/glqNMs\">Content Magazine</a> on January 7 and stay tuned for the full fashion editorial piece.
