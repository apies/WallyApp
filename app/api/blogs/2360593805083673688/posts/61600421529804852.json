We've only had it for a little while, but I've already found that there is something really wonderful about growing something that you can eat. It grows and replenishes itself, providing tasty, never-ending enhancements to soups, stews, and pastas, and all it asks for is a bit of care and attention. Every morning, before I start my day, I check its soil to make sure it has enough water, and I open the blinds to let the sun in to kiss its leaves. We've been using it up every chance we get, and it just keeps on giving. I am sort of in love with it.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPMxaL7HrbI/AAAAAAAAExk/M2lqTZLluwA/s1600/basil.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPMxaL7HrbI/AAAAAAAAExk/M2lqTZLluwA/s1600/basil.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544829892170329522\" border=\"0\" /></a>The green is so pretty and does wonders to brighten up the kitchen counter.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPMxZy2s-KI/AAAAAAAAExc/WhVzPMU3p1o/s1600/pesto%2Bpasta.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 400px;\" src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TPMxZy2s-KI/AAAAAAAAExc/WhVzPMU3p1o/s1600/pesto%2Bpasta.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5544829885440915618\" border=\"0\" /></a>Korb uses his basil to make homemade pesto.
