This past weekend, I finally went! A few friends and I met up at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/e6XngC\">singlebarrel</a>, a speakeasy in San Jose, for a completely charming experience and possibly the best cocktail I've ever had (the Bramble). Below are my favorite parts from my first speakeasy experience.<br /><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UhIzTDJysYc/TZLGZMEplgI/AAAAAAAAGek/M-PeaJlsJXc/s1600/single%2Bbarrel%2Bspeakeasy.jpg\" onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\"><img style=\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 600px; height: 800px;\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UhIzTDJysYc/TZLGZMEplgI/AAAAAAAAGek/M-PeaJlsJXc/s1600/single%2Bbarrel%2Bspeakeasy.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5589748223559964162\" /></a><div>1. Located in a completely unmarked building, the speakeasy can be easy to miss. Patrons can find the entrance by looking for the <i>single barrel</i> (get it? ;) mounted above the door. </div><div>2. I never know what to order at bars, and usually I get something pretty standard like a cranberry vodka just because I don't know what else I'd like. Luckily, singlebarrel makes it easy for people like me--right when you walk in, a bartender greets you and asks you questions about what flavors and liquors you like. Based on your answers, the bartender will choose your first drink for you. I told our bartender that I liked fruity, slightly tart flavors and a light alcohol taste. He was right on the money when he made me a Bramble, a gin-based cocktail mixed with blackberry liqueur--it tasted like a grown-up version of a snow cone. </div><div>3. Although the decor is minimal, the ambiance is great. They also use vintage-looking cocktail napkins made of real fabric which is a really cute touch. </div><div>4. They are all about slowing things down and so it shouldn't have been surprising (although it was) when our bartender pulled a big wooden hammer off the wall to smash the ice for our drinks. All the juices were hand-squeezed, too.</div><div>5. The bartenders wear newsboy caps and tell you stories from back in the day as they make your drinks.  </div><div><br /></div><div>Just as I expected, I'm a big fan of speakeasies! Have you been to one before? Are you as big a fan as I am? </div><div> </div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7005130774815938320/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
