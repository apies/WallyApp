In Hong Kong, for example, none of us could resist a trip to McDonald's to see if the Big Mac was still called the Big Mac (it was) and if there were any cool regional specials to be had (there were). Most of the items were the same as the ones that can be found on your local menu, but there were two that stuck out: the red bean pie and the Ebi burger. The red bean pie looks just like a McDonald's apple pie, but is instead filled with a sweet red bean paste. With hints of floral notes, the pie was good, but not exactly my cup of tea.<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TVDnqB0tAJI/AAAAAAAAFIw/nbH8acxAdF0/s1600/mcdonalds%2Bebi%2Bburger.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 267px;\" src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TVDnqB0tAJI/AAAAAAAAFIw/nbH8acxAdF0/s400/mcdonalds%2Bebi%2Bburger.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5571207448287314066\" border=\"0\" /></a>While I could do without the red bean pie, the Ebi burger was really good. If it were on the menu here, I would eat at McDonald's a whole lot more. It's a fried shrimp patty topped with crisp lettuce, a bit of mustard and the same sauce that comes on the Big Mac, all sandwiched between a soft, perfectly steamed bun. It sounds so weird, but it's <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">so</span> good!<br /><br /><a onblur=\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TVDnpuBqK8I/AAAAAAAAFIo/Vn3iJt1kvhI/s1600/pineapple%2Bcustard%2Bbuns.JPG\"><img style=\"display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 267px;\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TVDnpuBqK8I/AAAAAAAAFIo/Vn3iJt1kvhI/s400/pineapple%2Bcustard%2Bbuns.JPG\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5571207442972945346\" border=\"0\" /></a>For breakfast in Hong Kong, I made it a point to eat as many pineapple custard buns as possible.
