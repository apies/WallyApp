First up is a blowdrying tip for girls with naturally wavy hair, like me! Up until recently, I'd never blow dry my hair. Anytime I'd try, my hair would just end up looking weird and fluffy.<br />\n<br />\nSophie also has naturally wavy hair, and when she was <a href=\"http://bit.ly/PVvlwj\" target=\"_blank\">staying at our apartment</a>, I discovered her secret for voluminous, defined waves...<br />\n<br />\n<a name='more'></a><br />\nUse a diffuser!<br />\n<br />\nHere are her steps:<br />\n<br />\n1) Before you shower, comb the knots out of your hair.<br />\n2) Afterwards, run a little bit of product through your damp hair (I like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M6GTHQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004M6GTHQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quilikhor-20\">Aveda's Be Curly Style Prep</a>, but Sophie says any hair gel also works).<br />\n3) Flip your head upside down and blow dry sections of your hair with the diffuser attached.<br />\n4) Once it's all dry, you can straighten your bangs if you'd like.<br />\n<br />\nAnd that's it! It's so simple that I can't believe I've never used a diffuser before. I've done it a few times now (like when I first met my friend Jennifer's baby girl, above) and love how it enhances the natural texture of my waves, making it so much bouncier than when I air dry.<br />\n<br />\nDo you blow dry your hair? Have you ever used a diffuser? Am I the only one who thought they looked overly complicated and would throw them away?<br />\n<br />\n<br />","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8467576100042341179/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
