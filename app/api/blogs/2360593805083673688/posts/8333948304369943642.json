(A few weeks ago I was craving fried eggs over easy with chives, green onions, and soy sauce over brown rice for dinner--<span style=\"font-style:italic;\">random</span>). This weekend it was blueberry muffins with cream cheese filling. I knew exactly what I wanted the muffins to taste like--moist, berry-filled, and dense--and so when I found <a href=\"http://bit.ly/o0XsUn\">this recipe</a> I rejoiced. I decided it'd be fun to whip them up on Sunday morning to bring along as a snack after hiking with our friends <a href=\"http://bit.ly/pdOtu9\">Stacy</a> and Robbie. Since we were running out the door to meet them, and because the muffins were still cooling, I didn't get a chance to taste them until after the hike. For having an entire stick of butter in them, these muffins were pretty lackluster*. They were dry and boring, and I was even a little embarrassed to be serving them to my hungry friends. Not to mention that my craving for decadent muffins had yet to be fulfilled.</div><div><br /><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 238); -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline; \"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2nz8nsPdJ_Y/TiUNto1PboI/AAAAAAAAI_8/o0Rks9FoT-c/s1600/muffin1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5630921986802675330\" style=\"display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 600px; height: 429px; \" /></span><div><div style=\"text-align: center;\">{*In this recipe's defense, the problem could have simply been that I had over-baked the muffins. The recipe calls for baking 18-22 minutes and even though I baked them for exactly 18, I should have checked them a few minutes sooner.}</div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\">That night I quietly sulked about the failed muffins and ate two more to make sure they wouldn't hit the spot (they didn't). Then I remembered the blueberry muffin recipe I had used once in college (my muffin baking sure went on hiatus, didn't it?) They were really moist and so good that I still remember them fondly to this day, so I did a little digging through my recipe file and found it! Combining the best of both recipes, I made another batch of muffins the following night. They were exactly what I wanted, and after eating just one, I finally felt satisfied. So here, if the craving ever strikes, is my recipe for the perfect cream cheese-filled blueberry muffin that also doubles really well as an after-dinner dessert.</div><div><div><br /></div><div><b>Blueberry Muffins with Cream Cheese Filling</b></div><div>Adapted from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/o0XsUn\">this recipe</a> and <a href=\"http://bit.ly/q5XNZK\">this recipe</a></div><div><br /></div><div>1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</div><div>3/4 cup white sugar</div><div>1/2 teaspoon salt</div><div>2 teaspoons baking powder</div><div>1/3 cup vegetable oil (I used olive oil which added a strong flavor, but I love olive oil and so I didn't mind. Next time, I think I might try using butter)</div><div>1 egg</div><div>1/3 cup milk</div><div>1 cup fresh blueberries (I used frozen and the muffins still came out great)</div><div><br /></div></div></div></div><div>Filling:</div><div>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</div><div>1/4 cup sugar</div><div>2 tablespoons brown sugar, optional (I left this out since I thought the muffins would be sweet enough without this extra sugar and was glad I did)</div><div><br /></div><div>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line muffin tin with muffin liners. </div><div>Combine 1 1/2 cups flour, 3/4 cup sugar, salt and baking powder in a bowl. Place vegetable oil into a 1-cup measuring cup; add the egg and enough milk to fill the cup. Mix this with flour mixture. Fold in blueberries. Fill muffin cups right to the top. </div><div>To make filling, mix cream cheese and sugar in a small bowl at medium speed with a hand mixer until well combined and creamy, about 2 minutes. With two teaspoons (like the ones that you use at the dinner table) create a well in the center of a muffin and place a heaping spoonful of cream cheese in that well. Be sure not to go to the bottom of the muffin. (This \"creating a well\" business was trickier than it sounded. My wells always caved in on themselves so that I ended up with less of a cream cheese well and more of a cream cheese dollop floating on top, but I'm sure they taste equally as good.) Lightly sprinkle just a bit of brown sugar over each muffin if you'd like. </div><div>Bake for 18-22 minutes or until done (a toothpick inserted in the cake part of the muffin will come out clean.) </div><div><br /></div><div>Makes 8 muffins.</div><div><br /></div>","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/8333948304369943642/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
