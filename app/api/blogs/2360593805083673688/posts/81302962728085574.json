This one is Murakami's latest novel,&nbsp;<i>1Q84.</i>&nbsp;We've read many of the same books before but have only read a book <i>together</i> once, reaching the end at about the same time. We hadn't plan on doing it, but we both somehow got sucked into the story and couldn't stop reading. (It was <a href=\"http://amzn.to/GET0vi\" target=\"_blank\">this book</a>). Since it was so much fun we decided to do it again. It's kind of like the experience of watching a movie together except it's at each person's own pace which I think makes things a lot more interesting. You can either feel really antsy if you have to wait for the other person to catch up to where you are or really excited if you can tell from the other person that you're about to get to a juicy turning point in the story. Have you ever done it?","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/81302962728085574/comments"},"labels":["To See"]}
