In college, I got a bit more adventurous and would take the bus to the Vidal Sassoon Academy in Santa Monica to get my hair cut by the students for $20. It would take <i>hours, </i>but they always gave me the most interesting cuts. A few years after graduating, I was surprised at how much I loved my hair when I grew it long. Now it's so long that it sometimes catches me by surprise when I move a certain way and feel the length of it against my back. It's also gotten kind of blah, so this weekend I finally decided to make an appointment to get it cut.</div><div><br /></div><div>Lately I've been crushing on super super short hair styles (they just look so cool!), but I doubt I'll have the guts to lop it all off. Have you ever? Would you ever?
