The hard part is that office life isn't very conducive to getting&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/GE195x\" target=\"_blank\">abs like this</a>&nbsp;and I abhor the gym. In college I'd go to the gym every day—<i>no matter what—</i>which has left me with a permanent aversion. Luckily one healthy habit from college has stuck with me which is my love for walking. Everyone would complain about UCLA's hilly campus (I would, too), but looking back, being able to walk or take a short bus ride everywhere you needed to go was pretty rad. Since I've started working, I always try to find a friend to go on a lunch walk with me. I hit the jackpot at Coupons.com since just about my entire team likes getting out after lunch. We do a 1.8 mile loop almost every day. I know some people hate walking, but it's one of my favorite forms of exercise, especially when you consider that:</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"></div><a name='more'></a><br />\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*you can do it almost anywhere</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*all you need are a pair of comfy shoes tucked away in a desk drawer to get going</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*you have time to talk to people you might not get to talk to that much during the day&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*if no one wants to walk with you, you have time to listen to an episode of This American Life</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*it's refreshing</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*it's free</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">*it spurs creativity</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\"><br />\n</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">My 3 other tips for sneaking in office exercise:&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">1) If no one's walking by, I'll sneak in this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GE2d9r\" target=\"_blank\">ab exercise in my office chair</a>.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">2) When I had a cube tucked away in a corner, I was a big fan of <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GFDkNc\" target=\"_blank\">conference call push-ups</a>, though it's &nbsp;harder to do them discretely in my current cube.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">3) When I worked in an office building, I'd sometimes take the stairs to the 15th floor.</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: left;\">4) And, not really an exercise tip for the office, but my co-worker Jill (who's in amazing shape) told me about <a href=\"http://bit.ly/GGeibJ\" target=\"_blank\">this workout</a> which she said was really intense.
