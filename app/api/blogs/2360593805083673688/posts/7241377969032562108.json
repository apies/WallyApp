It was my first time working with royal icing (which dries hard to the touch), and it was so fun. I'll have to experiment closer to Christmas with the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/n09fHi\">piping and flooding technique</a>, but for those looking for a quick way to frost, this is what I did:<br />\n<br />\n1) Place a generous amount of frosting in the center of the cookie.<br />\n2) Using a butter knife, push the frosting out from the center to the edges, stopping a 1/4 inch from the edge.<br />\n3) Smooth frosting over in a circular motion.<br />\n<br />\nIt's&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not the most precise method, but it's very fast and easy. For the white accents, I just filled a sandwich bag with frosting and used this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/mWrI9I\">tip</a>. I think making tiny pearl borders was my favorite part of the whole thing.<br />\n<br />\n<b>Cream Cheese Sugar Cookies</b><br />\nBarely adapted from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/mRTWdz\">Blonde Designs</a><br />\n<br />\n1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened<br />\n3 oz. cream cheese, softened<br />\n1/2 cup sugar<br />\n1 egg<br />\npinch of salt<br />\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br />\n3 cups flour<br />\n<br />\n1. Cream butter and cream cheese until fluffy; add sugar and mix.<br />\n2. Add egg, salt, and vanilla; mix well.<br />\n3. Add flour. Be careful to not overmix. Wrap dough in plastic and chill several hours or overnight.<br />\n4. Roll out on floured surface and cut out cookies (keep on thicker side). Bake on ungreased sheet at 375 degrees until edges begin to barely brown. Cool completely and frost.<br />\n<br />\n---<br />\n<br />\n<b>Royal Icing</b><br />\nFrom <a href=\"http://bit.ly/nQa2ba\">Martha Stewart</a><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n2 large egg whites, or more to thin icing<br />\n4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar, or more to thicken icing<br />\n1 lemon, juiced<br />\n<br />\n1. Beat the whites until stiff but not dry.<br />\n2. Add sugar and lemon juice; beat for 1 minute more. If icing is too thick, add more egg whites; if it is too thin, add more sugar.<br />\n3. Add food coloring if desired (I am partial to this <a href=\"http://bit.ly/p4Fnoj\">icing color gel</a> which produces the most vibrant colors by using just the teeniest amount).&nbsp;The icing may be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/7241377969032562108/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
