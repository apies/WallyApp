It was a long drive there and back, but it was worth it because I finally got to eat at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/jwJrUQ\">Splash Cafe</a> after a failed attempt last July. Splash is famous for their clam chowder, which, I'll admit, was impressively creamy and rich, but what I really loved were their steamed clams. They came in some sort of tomato/butter/wine sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my extra bread into. We also got an order of sea scallops and chips to share, but I ate most of those since Alan's not a big scallop fan. They were well-seasoned and definitely tasty, but were overshadowed by my love connection with the clams. I need to find a recipe for that sauce ASAP.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"2","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/5281836875716932802/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
