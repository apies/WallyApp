They were lightly&nbsp;sautéed&nbsp;and simply prepared&nbsp;with just a little bit of garlic and oil, but they were delicious. Unlike spinach, wilted pea sprouts don't leave that <a href=\"http://bit.ly/LLiS0n\" target=\"_blank\">dry-mouth feeling</a> spinach sometimes does, and since they're stemmy, they retain a magnificent bite when cooked. They're my favorite vegetable right now, especially since I discovered I could buy a huge bag of them for just $1.50 at the Chinese supermarket. I've eaten them almost every day this week and still have more than half a bag left. I've wilted them for a quick side, put them in sandwiches, and—the winning recipe this week—tossed them in a salad with ripe peach slices, mini heirloom tomatoes, and Persian cucumbers for a refreshing first course.","author":{"id":"06629562195146939698","displayName":"Sobrina Tung","url":"http://www.blogger.com/profile/06629562195146939698","image":{"url":"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mkw1MyhyGTY/TI8X4CO5nWI/AAAAAAAAERk/4p5D74gYdFE/S45/me.JPG"}},"replies":{"totalItems":"4","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/blogger/v3/blogs/2360593805083673688/posts/932537966434203885/comments"},"labels":["To Eat"]}
